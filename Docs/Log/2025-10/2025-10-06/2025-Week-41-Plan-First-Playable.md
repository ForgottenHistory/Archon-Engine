# Week 41 Plan: First Playable Game Loop

**Date:** 2025-10-06 to 2025-10-12
**Milestone:** First Playable - "Select Province â†’ Build Farm â†’ Income Increases"
**Estimated Effort:** 7 days
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planning

---

## Overview

### Goal
Transform Hegemon from a technical demo into a playable game with a complete feedback loop:
1. Player can click provinces and see detailed information
2. Player can view country statistics (treasury, provinces, development)
3. Monthly tax collection generates visible income
4. Player can build a farm to increase development/income

### Why This Sequence?
- **Day 1-2 (Interaction):** Foundation - makes existing data accessible
- **Day 3-5 (Economy):** Core loop - money flows, player sees progress
- **Day 6-7 (Buildings):** Player agency - can improve provinces

### Success Criteria
By end of week, player can:
- âœ… Click a province and see: owner, development, terrain, income
- âœ… View country panel: treasury, total provinces, total development
- âœ… Watch treasury increase each month from tax collection
- âœ… Build a farm in a province (costs money, provides bonus)
- âœ… See income increase after building farm

## Architecture Decisions

### Layer Separation
- **Engine Layer:** ProvinceSystem, CountrySystem, TimeManager, CommandProcessor (already exist)
- **Game Layer:** Economic formulas, building definitions, UI panels

### Data Flow
```
User clicks province â†’ ProvinceSelector â†’ UI Panel updates
User clicks "Build Farm" â†’ BuildBuildingCommand â†’ CommandProcessor
TimeManager MonthlyTick â†’ EconomySystem.CollectTaxes() â†’ Treasury updated
```

### New Systems Location

```

### Unity Assets
- ProvinceInfoPanel.prefab
- CountryInfoPanel.prefab
- Farm.asset (ScriptableObject)
- Building icons (sprites)

---

## Architecture Validation

### Engine Usage (No Engine Changes!)
- âœ… ProvinceSystem.GetProvinceState() - read province data
- âœ… CountrySystem.GetCountryColor() - country info
- âœ… TimeManager.OnMonthlyTick - trigger tax collection
- âœ… CommandProcessor.SubmitCommand() - building construction
- âœ… EventBus.Subscribe<TreasuryChanged>() - UI updates
- âœ… ProvinceQueries, CountryQueries - data access

### Game Layer Additions
- âœ… EconomySystem (IGameSystem interface - future)
- âœ… Economic formulas (game policy)
- âœ… Building definitions (game content)
- âœ… UI panels (game presentation)

### Determinism Check
- âœ… All calculations use FixedPoint64
- âœ… Commands are deterministic
- âœ… No Unity.Random calls
- âœ… Tax collection order is deterministic (iterate provinces in ID order)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues

**UI Layout Complexity**
- **Risk:** UI panels overlap or look bad
- **Mitigation:** Use anchored layouts, test at multiple resolutions
- **Fallback:** Simple text-based UI first, polish later

**Building Modifier System**
- **Risk:** Complex modifier stacking (multiple buildings)
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple +X bonuses, avoid percentages
- **Fallback:** Buildings only affect development, not income directly

**Performance with Many Buildings**
- **Risk:** Iterating all buildings per province expensive
- **Mitigation:** Cache province income per-frame (frame-coherent)
- **Fallback:** Recalculate only when buildings change (dirty flag)

**Treasury Overflow**
- **Risk:** FixedPoint64 overflow with large treasuries
- **Mitigation:** Clamp to reasonable max (1,000,000 gold)
- **Fallback:** Treasury as FixedPoint64 has huge range (Â±2 billion)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Daily Tests
**Day 1:** Click provinces, verify panel updates
**Day 2:** Change ownership, verify country panel updates
**Day 3:** Check income calculations match formulas
**Day 4:** Play 12 months, verify treasury grows correctly
**Day 5:** Use dev commands, verify economy updates
**Day 6:** Build farm command, verify gold deducted
**Day 7:** Full loop: start â†’ build farm â†’ income increases

### Integration Test (End of Week)
1. Start new game
2. Player country has 100 gold, 10 provinces
3. Month 1: Collect ~10 gold tax (assume avg dev 10)
4. Month 2: Treasury = 110 gold
5. Build farm in capital (cost 50, dev +2)
6. Treasury = 60 gold
7. Month 3: Collect ~10.5 gold (farm adds +0.5)
8. Treasury = 70.5 gold
9. **Success:** Income increased after building farm

---

## Next Week Preview (Week 42)

After completing first playable, logical next steps:

**Option A: Expand Economy**
- More buildings (5-10 total)
- Building categories (economic, military, cultural)
- Province trade goods (bonus resources)

**Option B: Add Military**
- Army units (strength, movement)
- Combat resolution
- Conquer provinces via military

**Option C: Multiple Countries + AI**
- Other countries also collect taxes
- Other countries build buildings
- Simple AI (build farms when gold > 100)

**Option D: Save/Load**
- Serialize economy state
- Save/load commands
- Continue game across sessions

**Recommendation:** Option A (Expand Economy) â†’ builds on this week's foundation, low risk, high value

---

## Notes for Claude

### Context for Future Sessions
This week plan creates the **first playable game loop** - the foundation for all future gameplay systems. Every system after this (military, diplomacy, AI) will interact with the economy.

### Key Architecture Principles
- Game layer defines formulas and content
- Engine provides data structures and APIs
- Commands for all state changes
- Events for UI updates
- FixedPoint64 for all calculations

### If Things Go Wrong
- **Behind schedule:** Cut day 7 (building UI), add next week
- **UI too complex:** Text-only panels first, visual polish later
- **Bugs in economy:** Add debug logging, unit tests for calculations

### When to Ask for Help
- Treasury not updating â†’ check TimeManager.OnMonthlyTick subscription
- UI not updating â†’ check EventBus subscription
- Commands failing â†’ check validation logic
- Determinism broken â†’ check for float usage
