# Mesh Border Debugging - Jagged Edges Investigation
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Session**: 3
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial - Borders rendering but still jagged
**Priority**: High

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Fix jagged/stair-stepped appearance of mesh-based triangle strip borders

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Verify Chaikin smoothing is being applied
- Ensure Bézier curve tessellation is working correctly
- Achieve smooth curves matching Imperator Rome quality

**Success Criteria:**
- Borders render as smooth curves without visible stair-stepping
- Tessellation eliminates jagged pixel-perfect appearance
- Visual quality matches Paradox reference screenshots

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- Session 2 (Oct 30): Implemented triangle strip mesh rendering, fixed 65k vertex limit, disabled shader borders
- Borders now rendering via mesh but appearance is jagged/segmented
- User: "The shape isn't that curvy, clearly still segmented lines"

**Current State:**
- Triangle strip topology working ✓
- Mesh rendering active (18 province meshes, 3 country meshes) ✓
- Borders visible but jagged - stair-step appearance from pixel-perfect extraction
- Chaikin smoothing code exists but was NOT being called

**Why Now:**
- Borders rendering but quality unacceptable (jagged instead of smooth)
- Need to trace through entire pipeline to find smoothing failure
- User patience running thin after months of border work

---

## What We Did

### 1. Disabled Debug Shader Border Rendering
**Files Changed:** `MapModeCommon.hlsl:168-187`

**Problem:** Both shader-based AND mesh-based borders rendering simultaneously
- User: "I see a large thick white border and two red lines as outlines"
- Shader had debug code unconditionally rendering red/white borders

**Solution:**
```hlsl
// Early return when both border strengths are 0 (mesh rendering mode)
if (_CountryBorderStrength < 0.01 && _ProvinceBorderStrength < 0.01)
{
    return baseColor;
}

// Commented out debug rendering code
// if (borderMask > 0.1) { baseColor.rgb = float3(1, 0, 0); }
// if (borderMask > 0.3) { baseColor.rgb = float3(1, 1, 1); }
```

**Result:** Shader borders disabled, only mesh borders visible

### 2. Fixed Border Width - Made Debugging Visible
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:173-176`

**Iterations:**
- Initially: 10,000x thicker (2.0 world units) - covered entire map
- Reduced: 100x thicker (0.02 world units) - still very wide
- Final debug: 10x thicker (0.002 world units) - visible but not overwhelming

**Current setting:** `halfWidth = 0.001f` (10x Paradox's 0.0002)

### 3. Added Bézier Curve Tessellation
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:66-86`

**Problem:** Only using Bézier segment endpoints (P0, P3), creating jagged lines

**Solution:** Sample along curves
```csharp
const int samplesPerSegment = 20; // Increased from 10

for (int i = 0; i < segments.Count; i++)
{
    var seg = segments[i];

    if (i == 0)
        polyline.Add(seg.P0);

    // Sample along Bézier curve
    for (int s = 1; s <= samplesPerSegment; s++)
    {
        float t = s / (float)samplesPerSegment;
        Vector2 point = EvaluateBezier(seg, t);
        polyline.Add(point);
    }
}
```

**Added method:** `EvaluateBezier()` - cubic Bézier formula evaluation

**Result:** More vertices along curves, but STILL jagged (curve itself not smooth)

### 4. Fixed Perpendicular Calculation - World Space
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:190-223, 268-298`

**Problem:** Perpendiculars calculated in pixel space, then incorrectly scaled to world space

**Original broken code:**
```csharp
Vector2 perpPixels = CalculatePerpendicular(polyline, i);
float perpX = (perpPixels.x / mapWidth) * 10f * halfWidth; // WRONG
float perpZ = (perpPixels.y / mapHeight) * 10f * halfWidth;
```

**Fixed approach:**
```csharp
// First pass: convert all polyline points to world space
List<Vector3> worldPoints = new List<Vector3>();
for (int i = 0; i < polyline.Count; i++)
{
    float x = 5f - (p.x / mapWidth) * 10f;
    float z = (p.y / mapHeight) * 10f - 5f;
    worldPoints.Add(new Vector3(x, 0, z));
}

// Second pass: calculate perpendiculars IN world space
Vector3 perpendicular = CalculatePerpendicularWorldSpace(worldPoints, i);
Vector3 offset = perpendicular * halfWidth;
```

**New method:** `CalculatePerpendicularWorldSpace()` - perpendicular in XZ plane
```csharp
// Perpendicular in XZ plane (rotate 90° around Y axis)
perp = new Vector3(-avgDir.z, 0, avgDir.x);
```

**Result:** User: "That's... better" - borders follow province shapes correctly now

### 5. CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Chaikin Smoothing Never Called!
**Files Changed:** `BorderCurveExtractor.cs:145-147`

**Investigation:**
- Searched for `SmoothCurve()` calls - found NONE
- `smoothingIterations = 5` configured but never used
- Bézier curves fitted directly to pixel-perfect jagged polylines

**Root Cause:**
```csharp
List<Vector2> mergedPath = MergeChains(allChains);
// MISSING: Chaikin smoothing step!
allCurveSegments = BezierCurveFitter.FitCurve(mergedPath, borderType);
```

**Fix Applied:**
```csharp
List<Vector2> mergedPath = MergeChains(allChains);

// CRITICAL: Apply Chaikin smoothing BEFORE Bézier fitting
List<Vector2> smoothedPath = SmoothCurve(mergedPath, smoothingIterations);

if (smoothedPath.Count >= 2)
{
    // Fit Bézier curves to SMOOTHED path
    allCurveSegments = BezierCurveFitter.FitCurve(smoothedPath, borderType);
}
```

**Expected Result:** Smooth sub-pixel curves from Chaikin → smooth Bézier curves → smooth mesh

**Actual Result:** User: "No, they still look the same"

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Calculate Perpendiculars in World Space
**Context:** Perpendiculars calculated in pixel space weren't scaling correctly to world space

**Decision:** Two-pass approach - convert to world space first, then calculate perpendiculars

**Rationale:**
- Pixel space has different aspect ratio than world space (5632×2048 vs 27.5×10)
- Unit vectors in pixel space don't map to unit vectors in world space
- World space perpendiculars are geometrically correct after transformation

**Result:** Borders now follow province boundaries correctly (confirmed by user)

### Decision 2: Add Chaikin Smoothing Before Bézier Fitting
**Context:** Discovered `SmoothCurve()` exists but was never called

**Decision:** Insert smoothing step between pixel extraction and Bézier fitting

**Rationale:**
- Chaikin smoothing creates sub-pixel precision curves from jagged pixels
- Bézier fitting on smooth data → smooth parametric curves
- This was the original October plan that got abandoned

**Expected:** Smooth borders like Imperator Rome

**Actual:** No visible change (still jagged) - PROBLEM UNRESOLVED

---

## What Worked ✅

1. **World Space Perpendicular Calculation**
   - What: Calculate perpendiculars after converting points to world space
   - Why it worked: Geometrically correct for non-square aspect ratios
   - User feedback: "That's... better"

2. **Disabling Shader Debug Code**
   - What: Commented out unconditional red/white border rendering
   - Why it worked: Removed visual interference from old rendering system
   - Impact: Can now see mesh borders clearly

3. **Bézier Tessellation**
   - What: Sample 20 points per Bézier segment instead of just endpoints
   - Why it worked: More vertices along curves for potential smoothness
   - Limitation: Doesn't help if curves themselves are jagged

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

### 1. Adding Chaikin Smoothing Before Bézier Fitting
**What we tried:** Insert `SmoothCurve(mergedPath, 5)` before `BezierCurveFitter.FitCurve()`

**Why it failed:** User reports no visible change - borders still jagged

**Possible reasons:**
1. Bézier fitting might be "un-smoothing" the Chaikin results
2. Chaikin smoothing not aggressive enough (only 5 iterations)
3. Bézier MAX_FIT_ERROR too high (1.5px) - might be fitting to jagged original
4. Endpoint quantization (0.5px grid) might be snapping smooth points back to pixels
5. Junction snapping might be undoing smoothing at endpoints

**Root cause unknown** - needs deeper investigation

**Lesson learned:** Adding smoothing to pipeline doesn't guarantee smooth output if later stages undo it

**Don't try this again because:** More investigation needed before trying different approach

### 2. Increasing Tessellation from 10 to 20 Samples
**What we tried:** Double Bézier sampling resolution

**Why it failed:** User: "I don't even see a difference"

**Root cause:** Tessellation quality doesn't matter if underlying curves are jagged

**Lesson learned:** Can't tessellate your way out of jagged source data

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Both Shader and Mesh Borders Rendering
**Symptom:** User: "I have a large thick white border and two red lines as outlines"

**Root Cause:**
- Mesh rendering active (new system)
- Shader debug code unconditionally rendering borders (old system)
- Both systems drawing at same time

**Investigation:**
- Read `MapModeCommon.hlsl:170-179`
- Found hardcoded debug visualization: `if (borderMask > 0.1) return red`
- This ran BEFORE checking border strength values

**Solution:** Commented out debug code, added early return when strength = 0

**Result:** Only mesh borders visible

### Problem 2: Borders Covering Entire Map (10,000x Width)
**Symptom:** User: "The entire map is black"

**Root Cause:** `halfWidth = 1.0f` = half the map width in world space

**Investigation:**
- Checked logs: "First render - Province: 18 meshes, Country: 3 meshes" (rendering IS happening)
- Realized 1.0 world units is MASSIVE (map is only 27.5 units wide)
- Borders were occluding everything

**Solution:** Reduced to `halfWidth = 0.01f` (100x), then `0.001f` (10x)

**Result:** Borders visible but not overwhelming

### Problem 3: Jagged Borders Despite Tessellation
**Symptom:** User: "They do follow the border but the shape isn't that curvy, clearly still segmented lines"

**Root Cause:** Bézier curves fitted to pixel-perfect jagged polylines (no smoothing)

**Investigation:**
1. Checked if tessellation working - YES (20 samples per segment)
2. Searched for `SmoothCurve()` calls - NONE FOUND
3. Discovered Chaikin smoothing exists but never called
4. Added smoothing before Bézier fitting

**Solution Attempted:** Insert Chaikin smoothing into pipeline

**Result:** User: "No, they still look the same" - UNRESOLVED

**Why This Doesn't Work:** Unknown - possibilities:
- Bézier fitting parameters undoing smoothing
- Endpoint snapping reverting to pixel grid
- Junction handling interfering
- Need to investigate Bézier fitting algorithm

**Pattern for Future:** Smoothing in pipeline doesn't guarantee smooth output - check all pipeline stages

---

## Architecture Impact

### Pipeline Now Includes Chaikin Smoothing
**Changed:** Border extraction pipeline
**From:** Pixels → Merge → Bézier Fit → Tessellate → Mesh
**To:** Pixels → Merge → **Chaikin Smooth** → Bézier Fit → Tessellate → Mesh
**Scope:** BorderCurveExtractor.cs - single line addition
**Reason:** Should create smooth curves, but not working as expected

### World Space Perpendicular Calculation
**Pattern:** Two-pass vertex generation
1. First pass: Convert all points to world space
2. Second pass: Calculate perpendiculars in world space
**Benefits:** Geometrically correct for non-uniform scaling
**Reusable:** Yes - standard technique for aspect ratio correction

---

## Code Quality Notes

### Performance
**Measured:**
- Mesh generation: 209ms (up from 24ms in session 2)
- Vertex count: 1,147,618 province vertices (up from 129k)
- 18 province meshes (up from 2)
**Reason for increase:** 20x tessellation = 20x more vertices
**Status:** Still acceptable for initialization

### Testing
**Manual:** Visual inspection shows jagged borders
**Missing:** Why doesn't Chaikin smoothing produce visible results?

### Technical Debt
**Created:**
- Chaikin smoothing added but not working - need deeper investigation
- Bézier fitting parameters may need tuning
- Endpoint quantization may be counterproductive
**TODOs:**
- Investigate why smoothing has no visible effect
- Check Bézier MAX_FIT_ERROR tolerance
- Test with more Chaikin iterations
- Verify SmoothCurve() is actually running (add logging)

---

## Next Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Add logging to verify Chaikin smoothing actually runs** - Confirm it's not silently failing
2. **Log point counts before/after smoothing** - Verify smoothing changes data
3. **Investigate Bézier fitting parameters** - MAX_FIT_ERROR, endpoint quantization
4. **Test with extreme Chaikin iterations (20+)** - Rule out insufficient smoothing
5. **Check junction snapping** - May be reverting smooth points to pixel grid

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Is SmoothCurve() actually executing?** (No logs confirm this)
2. **Does smoothing change the data?** (Point count before/after?)
3. **Does Bézier fitting undo smoothing?** (Check control point positions)
4. **Are endpoints being quantized back to pixel grid?** (Check ENDPOINT_QUANTIZATION)
5. **Do we need different smoothing approach?** (Gaussian blur? Spline fitting?)

### Blocked Items
- Cannot proceed with mesh rendering until jagged edges resolved
- Visual quality currently unacceptable for production

## Notes & Observations

**Session Tone:**
- Frustration building - "clearly still segmented lines"
- Multiple attempts at smoothing not producing results
- User: "I don't even see a difference" after doubling tessellation
- User: "Something wrong fundamentally?" - questioning entire approach

**The Mystery:**
Why doesn't Chaikin smoothing work?
- Function exists ✓
- Now being called ✓
- 5 iterations configured ✓
- Should create smooth sub-pixel curves ✓
- But... no visible change ❌

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Bézier fitting reverting to jagged:** MAX_FIT_ERROR = 1.5px might be too loose
2. **Endpoint quantization:** ENDPOINT_QUANTIZATION = 0.5px snaps smooth points to grid
3. **Junction snapping:** Post-processing may move smooth points back to pixels
4. **Insufficient iterations:** 5 Chaikin iterations might not be enough
5. **Smoothing not actually running:** Need logging to confirm execution

**User's Patience:**
- "nice to hear, i was just about to give up on all this, haha" (Session 1)
- Now in Session 3, still jagged borders
- Need breakthrough soon or user may abandon border work entirely

**Next Direction:**
Add comprehensive logging to trace data through pipeline:
- Log point count before/after Chaikin smoothing
- Log first few points before/after smoothing (verify coordinates change)
- Log Bézier control points (check if smooth or jagged)
- Log tessellation output (verify smooth vs jagged)

Only with data can we diagnose where smoothing is lost.

*Session ended with borders rendering but still jagged. Chaikin smoothing added to pipeline but producing no visible improvement. Need deeper investigation into Bézier fitting and junction processing.*
