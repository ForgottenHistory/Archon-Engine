# Pre-Allocation Policy & Sparse Data Infrastructure
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Session**: 4
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Complete remaining Paradox infrastructure priorities (Phase 3 & 4 from priorities doc)

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Document pre-allocation policy (Principle 4) in performance-architecture-guide.md
- Design comprehensive sparse data structures architecture
- Implement sparse collection infrastructure (Phase 1 & 2)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Pre-allocation policy documented with timeless principles (no code examples)
- ✅ Sparse data design document created (comprehensive architecture)
- ✅ Sparse infrastructure compiles and ready for future use
- ✅ All 4 Paradox priorities complete (implemented or designed)

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- See: [3-double-buffer-pattern-integration.md](3-double-buffer-pattern-integration.md) - Double-buffer pattern for zero-blocking UI
- See: [1-engine-infrastructure-priorities-from-paradox-analysis.md](1-engine-infrastructure-priorities-from-paradox-analysis.md) - Paradox lessons
- Related: [sparse-data-structures-design.md](../../Engine/sparse-data-structures-design.md) - Comprehensive design (created this session)

**Current State:**
- Load balancing: ✅ Complete (24.9% improvement at 10k provinces)
- Double-buffer pattern: ✅ Complete (zero-blocking UI reads)
- Pre-allocation policy: ⏳ Needed documentation
- Sparse data structures: ⏳ Needed design + implementation

**Why Now:**
Paradox learned these patterns through 15 years of production pain. Implementing NOW (before game complexity) is 10x cheaper than retrofitting later. HOI4's 30→500 equipment disaster proves this.

---

## What We Did

### 1. Pre-Allocation Policy Documentation (Phase 3)

**Files Changed:** `Docs/Engine/performance-architecture-guide.md:180-265`

**User Feedback on Code Examples:**
> "Ah, code examples are NOT AI optimized at all. This is supposed to be a more timeless document, code examples and file structures get outdated."

**Implementation:**
Rewrote entire Principle 4 section to use timeless principles instead of code examples:

**Key Patterns Documented:**
- **Initialization Phase:** Pre-allocate all temporary buffers with persistent lifetime
- **Gameplay Phase:** Clear and reuse (zero allocations = zero lock contention)
- **Cleanup Phase:** Dispose at shutdown only

**Decision Framework Added:**
```
Question: "Do I need dynamic storage?"
→ Yes, but bounded: NativeList with pre-allocated capacity
→ Yes, unbounded: Ring buffer pattern
→ No: Fixed-size NativeArray

Question: "When do I allocate?"
→ System initialization: Allocator.Persistent
→ Job-local temp: Pre-allocate in system, pass to job
→ Never: During gameplay loop
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows AI-optimized documentation principles (timeless, principle-focused)
- ✅ Complies with HOI4's malloc lock lesson (parallel code → sequential due to allocator contention)
- ✅ Aligns with existing performance architecture

**Commit:** `17d5c07` - Document pre-allocation policy (Principle 4)

---

### 2. Sparse Data Structures Design (Phase 4 - Design)

**Files Created:** `Docs/Engine/sparse-data-structures-design.md` (503 lines)

**Problem Statement:**
HOI4's 30 equipment types → 500 with mods = **16x slower**

**Root Cause:** Dense arrays scale with POSSIBLE items (must iterate 500 slots even if 5 exist)

**Design Solution: Three-Layer Architecture**

#### Layer 1: Definitions (Static Registry)
- Type definitions loaded from JSON5 at startup
- Example: BuildingDefinition, ModifierDefinition, TradeGoodDefinition
- Each gets unique ID (ushort) assigned at runtime
- StringID remains stable for save/load compatibility

#### Layer 2: Instance Storage (Sparse Collections)
- Which entities have which items
- NativeMultiHashMap (later renamed to NativeParallelMultiHashMap)
- Pre-allocated with Allocator.Persistent (Principle 4 compliance)

#### Layer 3: Access API (Query Layer)
- Fast lookups and iteration over ACTUAL items only
- Pattern A: Has() - O(m) where m = items per key
- Pattern B: Get() - O(m) returns NativeArray
- Pattern C: ProcessAll() - Parallel iteration
- Pattern D: Filter() - Which entities have item X?

**Memory Analysis:**
```
Dense Approach (HOI4's mistake):
10k provinces × 500 types × 1 byte = 5 MB
Must iterate all 500 types per province

Sparse Approach (our design):
10k provinces × 5 actual × 4 bytes = 200 KB
Only iterate actual items (5 per province)

Savings: 4.8 MB (96% reduction at mod scale)
```

**Pre-Allocation Strategy:**
```
Capacity estimation:
- Entities × Average items per entity × Safety margin (2x)
- Example: 10k provinces × 5 buildings × 2 = 100k capacity

Monitoring:
- Warn at 80% capacity
- Critical at 95% capacity
- Log memory usage for profiling
```

**Decision: Sparse vs Dense Matrix**

| Data Type | Base Count | Mod Multiplier | Most Entities Have | Pattern |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Owner/Terrain | N/A | N/A | ALL | Dense (ProvinceState) |
| Buildings | 30 | 5-10x | 0-5 | **Sparse** |
| Modifiers | 50 | 10-20x | 0-3 | **Sparse** |
| Trade Goods | 20 | 2-3x | 1-2 | **Sparse** |
| Development | N/A | N/A | ALL | Dense (Game layer) |

**Rule:** If mods multiply count AND most entities don't have most items → Sparse

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows engine-game separation (mechanism in engine, policy in game)
- ✅ Follows pre-allocation policy (Principle 4)
- ✅ Follows hot/cold data separation (only IDs stored, definitions separate)
- ✅ Burst-compatible (unmanaged constraints)

**Commit:** `8dba757` - Design sparse data structures architecture

---

### 3. Sparse Infrastructure Implementation (Phase 1 & 2)

**Files Created:**
- `Scripts/Core/Data/SparseData/IDefinition.cs` (54 lines)
- `Scripts/Core/Data/SparseData/ISparseCollection.cs` (108 lines)
- `Scripts/Core/Data/SparseData/SparseCollectionManager.cs` (381 lines)

#### IDefinition.cs - Base Interface for Definitions

**Purpose:** Enables mod compatibility with stable string identifiers

**Implementation:**
```csharp
public interface IDefinition
{
    ushort ID { get; set; }           // Runtime-assigned (0-65535)
    string StringID { get; }          // Stable for saves ("farm", "gold_mine")
    ushort Version { get; }           // Compatibility checks
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ID may differ between sessions (assigned at load)
- StringID stable across saves/mods ("farm" always "farm")
- Version allows definition evolution

**Pattern:** All game definitions (BuildingDefinition, ModifierDefinition) implement this

---

#### ISparseCollection.cs - Non-Generic Collection Interface

**Purpose:** Polymorphic management of different collection types

**Implementation:**
```csharp
public interface ISparseCollection : IDisposable
{
    string Name { get; }              // "ProvinceBuildings", "CountryModifiers"
    bool IsInitialized { get; }
    int Capacity { get; }             // Pre-allocated capacity
    int Count { get; }                // Current usage
    float CapacityUsage { get; }      // 0.0 to 1.0 (warns at 0.8)
    void Clear();                     // Reset without deallocating
    SparseCollectionStats GetStats(); // Memory monitoring
}

public struct SparseCollectionStats
{
    public string Name;
    public int Capacity;
    public int Count;
    public float CapacityUsage;
    public int EstimatedMemoryBytes;
    public bool HasCapacityWarning;
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Enables unified memory monitoring across all sparse collections
- Type-erased interface (no generics) for central management
- Tracks capacity usage (warns before overflow)

---

#### SparseCollectionManager<TKey, TValue> - Core Implementation

**Purpose:** Generic sparse storage that scales with ACTUAL usage

**Core Storage:**
```csharp
private NativeParallelMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue> data;  // Collections 2.1+ name
```

**Constraints:**
```csharp
where TKey : unmanaged, IEquatable<TKey>      // Burst-compatible
where TValue : unmanaged, IEquatable<TValue>  // Burst-compatible
```

**Pre-Allocation (Principle 4):**
```csharp
public void Initialize(string collectionName, int estimatedCapacity)
{
    // Pre-allocate with persistent lifetime
    data = new NativeParallelMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue>(
        capacity,
        Allocator.Persistent
    );

    // Calculate memory usage
    int entrySize = UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<TKey>() + UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<TValue>();
    int memoryKB = (capacity * entrySize) / 1024;

    ArchonLogger.Log($"SparseCollection '{name}' initialized: {capacity} capacity, ~{memoryKB} KB");
}
```

**Query APIs:**
```csharp
// Existence check: O(m) where m = items per key (typically 3-5)
public bool Has(TKey key, TValue value)

// Quick check: O(1)
public bool HasAny(TKey key)

// Get all values: O(m) - caller must dispose NativeArray!
public NativeArray<TValue> Get(TKey key, Allocator allocator = Allocator.TempJob)

// Count values: O(1)
public int GetCount(TKey key)
```

**Modification APIs:**
```csharp
// Add value: O(1) average case (allows duplicates!)
public void Add(TKey key, TValue value)

// Remove specific value: O(m)
public bool Remove(TKey key, TValue value)

// Remove all values for key: O(m)
public void RemoveAll(TKey key)
```

**Iteration APIs:**
```csharp
// Zero allocation callback-based iteration
public void ProcessValues(TKey key, Action<TValue> processor)

// Get all unique keys (caller must dispose!)
public NativeArray<TKey> GetKeys(Allocator allocator = Allocator.TempJob)
```

**Capacity Monitoring:**
```csharp
private const float WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.80f;   // 80%
private const float CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 0.95f;  // 95%

private void CheckCapacityWarnings()
{
    float usage = CapacityUsage;

    if (usage >= CRITICAL_THRESHOLD && !hasLoggedCritical)
    {
        ArchonLogger.LogWarning($"CRITICAL: {usage:P1} capacity used");
        hasLoggedCritical = true;
    }
    else if (usage >= WARNING_THRESHOLD && !hasLoggedWarning)
    {
        ArchonLogger.LogWarning($"WARNING: {usage:P1} capacity used");
        hasLoggedWarning = true;
    }
}
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Pre-allocation (Principle 4): Allocator.Persistent at initialization
- ✅ Burst-compatible: unmanaged constraints
- ✅ Zero allocations during gameplay: Add/Remove reuse capacity
- ✅ Memory monitoring: Automatic warnings at thresholds
- ✅ Hot/cold separation: Only IDs stored (definitions separate)

**Commit:** `a4ad225` - Implement sparse data infrastructure (Phase 1 & 2)

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Timeless Documentation (No Code Examples)

**Context:** User feedback - "code examples are NOT AI optimized at all... code examples and file structures get outdated"

**Options Considered:**
1. Code examples - specific, concrete, but outdates quickly
2. Principles only - timeless, AI-optimized, scannable
3. Hybrid - mix of both

**Decision:** Principles only (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- Documentation should outlast code changes
- Principles are timeless, implementation details change
- AI can better understand and apply principles than memorize code
- User explicitly requested this pattern

**Trade-offs:** Less immediately concrete, but more durable

**Documentation Impact:** Updated performance-architecture-guide.md with decision frameworks instead of code

---

### Decision 2: Sparse vs Dense for Different Data Types

**Context:** Need to decide which game data uses sparse collections vs dense arrays

**Decision Matrix Applied:**

**Dense (Fixed Arrays):**
- Owner/Controller (ProvinceState) - ALWAYS present
- Terrain (ProvinceState) - ALWAYS present
- Development (Game layer slot) - ALWAYS present

**Sparse (Collections):**
- Buildings - Most have 0-5 out of 100+ possible (5-10x with mods)
- Modifiers - Most have 0-3 out of 200+ possible (10-20x with mods)
- Trade Goods - Most have 1-2 out of 50 possible (2-3x with mods)

**Decision Rule:**
```
If (mods multiply count) AND (most entities don't have most items):
    → Use sparse collections
Else:
    → Use dense storage
```

**Rationale:** Prevents HOI4's 30→500 equipment disaster (16x slowdown)

**Trade-offs:** Slightly more complex access patterns (O(m) instead of O(1) per item), but 96% memory reduction and no wasted iteration

**Documentation Impact:** Added decision matrix to sparse-data-structures-design.md

---

### Decision 3: NativeMultiHashMap vs NativeHashMap

**Context:** Need one-to-many relationships (Province → multiple BuildingIDs)

**Options Considered:**
1. NativeHashMap<TKey, NativeList<TValue>> - nested allocations
2. NativeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue> - built-in one-to-many
3. Custom linked list - reinventing wheel

**Decision:** NativeMultiHashMap (later NativeParallelMultiHashMap)

**Rationale:**
- Built-in support for one-to-many
- No nested allocations
- Burst-compatible
- Pre-allocatable with single capacity

**Trade-offs:** Iteration is O(m) per key (acceptable for m=3-5)

**Documentation Impact:** Pattern documented in sparse-data-structures-design.md

---

### Decision 4: Phase 1 & 2 Now, Phase 3-5 Later

**Context:** Should we implement everything now or stage it?

**Options Considered:**
1. All phases now - complete but delayed
2. Phase 1 & 2 now (foundation + infrastructure), rest later
3. Design only, implement when needed

**Decision:** Phase 1 & 2 now, Phase 3-5 later (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1 & 2 are ENGINE mechanism (generic infrastructure)
- Phase 3-5 are GAME policy (BuildingDefinition, integration)
- Don't need game definitions until building systems exist
- Foundation ready for future use

**Phases:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (IDefinition, ISparseCollection, capacity planning)
- ✅ Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (SparseCollectionManager, query APIs)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Definition System (BuildingDefinition, etc) - Later
- ⏳ Phase 4: Integration (BuildingSystem using sparse collections) - Later
- ⏳ Phase 5: Mod Support (dynamic loading) - Later

**Trade-offs:** Can't test with real data yet, but foundation solid

**Documentation Impact:** Marked Phase 1 & 2 complete in design doc

---

## What Worked ✅

1. **AI-Optimized Documentation (Timeless Principles)**
   - What: Writing principles instead of code examples
   - Why it worked: Survives code changes, easier to scan, applies universally
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - apply to all architecture docs

2. **Design-First Approach**
   - What: Created 503-line design doc before implementing
   - Why it worked: Caught design issues early, comprehensive plan, clear goals
   - Impact: Zero rework during implementation
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - always design complex systems first

3. **Phased Implementation**
   - What: Phase 1 & 2 (foundation) now, Phase 3-5 (game policy) later
   - Why it worked: Aligns with engine-game separation, ready when needed
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - implement mechanism first, policy later

4. **Web Search for API Changes**
   - What: Discovering NativeMultiHashMap → NativeParallelMultiHashMap rename
   - Why it worked: Unity changes APIs between versions, web has truth
   - Impact: Fixed compilation immediately
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - always check Unity changelog for renamed types

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Initial Code Examples in Pre-Allocation Doc**
   - What we tried: Writing concrete code examples in performance-architecture-guide.md
   - Why it failed: User feedback - "code examples get outdated"
   - Lesson learned: AI-optimized docs use principles, not examples
   - Don't try this again because: Documentation should be timeless, code changes

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: CS0246 - NativeMultiHashMap Not Found

**Symptom:**
```
Assets\...\SparseCollectionManager.cs(44,17): error CS0246:
The type or namespace name 'NativeMultiHashMap<,>' could not be found
(are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

**Root Cause:** Unity Collections 2.1+ renamed `NativeMultiHashMap` → `NativeParallelMultiHashMap`

**Investigation:**
- Tried: Checked using directives (Unity.Collections present)
- Tried: Checked Core.asmdef (Unity.Collections referenced)
- Found: Web search revealed API rename in Collections 2.1+

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Before (Collections < 2.1)
private NativeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue> data;

// After (Collections 2.1+, Unity 2023)
private NativeParallelMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue> data;
```

**Why This Works:** Unity renamed type but functionality identical

**Pattern for Future:** Always check Unity changelog when using Unity.Collections types - they rename frequently between versions

---

## Architecture Impact

### Documentation Updates Required
- [x] Update performance-architecture-guide.md - Pre-allocation policy (Principle 4)
- [x] Create sparse-data-structures-design.md - Comprehensive architecture
- [x] Update Core/FILE_REGISTRY.md - New sparse data files
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md - Add sparse collections section (future)

### New Patterns Discovered

**Pattern: Three-Layer Sparse Data Architecture**
- When to use: Optional/rare data that scales with mods
- Layers: Definitions (static) → Storage (sparse) → Access (queries)
- Benefits: 96% memory reduction, scales with usage not possibility
- Add to: sparse-data-structures-design.md ✅ (added this session)

**Pattern: Capacity Monitoring with Thresholds**
- When to use: Pre-allocated collections with bounded capacity
- Thresholds: 80% warning, 95% critical
- Benefits: Prevents overflow, gives early warning for capacity tuning
- Add to: performance-architecture-guide.md (future)

**Pattern: Type-Erased Interface for Generic Collections**
- When to use: Need to manage multiple generic types polymorphically
- Example: ISparseCollection (non-generic) implemented by SparseCollectionManager<TKey, TValue>
- Benefits: Unified memory monitoring, disposal, stats
- Add to: engine-game-separation.md (future)

### Architectural Decisions That Changed

**Changed:** Engine infrastructure priorities roadmap
**From:** Undefined next steps after double-buffer
**To:** Pre-allocation policy documented, sparse data designed and implemented
**Scope:** All future systems that use optional/rare data
**Reason:** Complete Paradox-validated infrastructure before game complexity

---

## Code Quality Notes

### Performance
- **Measured:** Not yet (foundation only, no game data)
- **Target:** 96% memory reduction vs dense approach, zero allocations during gameplay
- **Status:** ⏳ Needs measurement when integrated with building systems

### Testing
- **Tests Written:** 0 (foundation only)
- **Coverage:** Manual compilation test only
- **Manual Tests:** Compilation successful, no runtime tests yet

### Technical Debt
- **Created:** None - clean implementation following design
- **Paid Down:** None
- **TODOs:** Phase 3-5 implementation when building systems created

---

## Next Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

**All 4 Paradox infrastructure priorities now complete!**
1. ✅ Load Balancing - Complete (24.9% improvement)
2. ✅ UI Data Access (Double-buffer) - Complete (zero blocking)
3. ✅ Pre-Allocation Policy - Complete (documented)
4. ✅ Sparse Data Structures - Complete (designed + Phase 1 & 2 implemented)

**Possible next directions:**
1. Begin game layer implementation (BuildingSystem, ModifierSystem using sparse collections)
2. Implement game-specific systems (economy, diplomacy, military)
3. Return to UI development (CountryInfoPanel using GameStateSnapshot)
4. Performance testing at scale (stress test sparse collections)

### Blocked Items
None - all infrastructure priorities unblocked

### Questions to Resolve
1. When to implement Phase 3 (BuildingDefinition, ModifierDefinition)?
   - Answer: When building systems are needed in game layer

2. Should we test sparse collections with synthetic data now?
   - Pro: Validates performance claims
   - Con: Not needed until real integration

3. What's the next game system to implement?
   - Buildings? Economy? Military? Diplomacy?

### Docs to Read Before Next Session
- If implementing buildings: [sparse-data-structures-design.md](../../Engine/sparse-data-structures-design.md) Phase 3-5
- If implementing economy: [engine-game-separation.md](../../Engine/engine-game-separation.md) for layer guidelines
- If implementing UI: [data-flow-architecture.md](../../Engine/data-flow-architecture.md) for GameStateSnapshot usage

## Quick Reference for Future Claude

**What Claude Should Know:**
- Sparse infrastructure location: `Scripts/Core/Data/SparseData/`
- Key implementation: `SparseCollectionManager.cs:44` (NativeParallelMultiHashMap)
- Design doc: `sparse-data-structures-design.md` (503 lines, comprehensive)
- Critical decision: Sparse for optional/rare data, dense for always-present data
- API name: Collections 2.1+ uses NativeParallelMultiHashMap (not NativeMultiHashMap)

**What Changed Since Last Doc Read:**
- Architecture: Added three-layer sparse data pattern (Definitions → Storage → Access)
- Implementation: Foundation complete (Phase 1 & 2), ready for game layer use
- Constraints: All sparse data must use SparseCollectionManager (don't reimplement)

**Gotchas for Next Session:**
- Watch out for: NativeParallelMultiHashMap (renamed from NativeMultiHashMap in Collections 2.1+)
- Don't forget: Caller must dispose NativeArray returned from Get() and GetKeys()
- Remember: Pre-allocate capacity at initialization (Principle 4), never during gameplay
- Don't reimplement: Use SparseCollectionManager, don't create custom sparse structures
- Engine vs Game: SparseCollectionManager = ENGINE mechanism, BuildingDefinition = GAME policy

## Notes & Observations

**The Paradox Infrastructure Arc is Complete:**

This session completes the 4 critical priorities identified from Paradox's 15 years of production experience:
1. ✅ Load Balancing (Victoria 3's cost-based scheduling)
2. ✅ UI Data Access (Victoria 3's profiler "waiting bars" lesson)
3. ✅ Pre-Allocation (HOI4's malloc lock contention)
4. ✅ Sparse Data (HOI4's 30→500 equipment disaster)

**The Big Picture:**

We now have foundational infrastructure that prevents four categories of performance collapse:
- Load balancing prevents: Thread starvation (expensive provinces on one thread)
- Double-buffer prevents: Lock contention (UI blocking simulation)
- Pre-allocation prevents: Malloc lock contention (parallel → sequential)
- Sparse collections prevent: Mod scaling disaster (memory/iteration explosion)

**What Makes This Different:**

Paradox learned these patterns by shipping broken performance and fixing it over years. We designed it right from day 1 by reading their lessons BEFORE implementing game systems. This is the advantage of learning from others' mistakes.

**User Feedback Impact:**

The insight about "AI-optimized documentation" (timeless principles, no code examples) was crucial. It shifted our documentation philosophy from "show code" to "teach principles." This makes docs more durable and easier for AI to understand/apply.

**Technical Learning:**

The NativeMultiHashMap → NativeParallelMultiHashMap rename taught us: Always check Unity changelog when using Collections package. Unity renames types frequently between versions. Web search is essential for Unity API changes.

**Design-First Wins:**

Creating the 503-line sparse-data-structures-design.md BEFORE implementing caught all design issues early. Zero rework during implementation. This validates the "design-first" approach for complex systems.

**What's Next:**

All infrastructure is ready. The next phase is game layer implementation:
- Building systems using sparse collections
- Economy systems using fixed-point math
- Military systems using deterministic simulation
- UI systems using GameStateSnapshot

The foundation is solid. Time to build the game.
