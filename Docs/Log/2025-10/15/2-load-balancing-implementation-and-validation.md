# Load Balancing Implementation & Validation
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Session**: 2
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Implement Victoria 3's "expensive vs affordable" load balancing pattern for heterogeneous workloads

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Create stress test to validate balancing effectiveness
- Establish cost estimation heuristic for provinces
- Maintain engine-game separation (mechanism vs policy)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ LoadBalancedScheduler compiles and works with Unity Jobs
- ✅ Stress test shows measurable improvement (>15%) with heterogeneous workloads
- ✅ Engine provides mechanism, Game provides policy (cost estimation)
- ✅ Test runs at scale (10,000 provinces)

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- See: [1-engine-infrastructure-priorities-from-paradox-analysis.md](./1-engine-infrastructure-priorities-from-paradox-analysis.md)
- Related: [performance-architecture-guide.md](../../Engine/performance-architecture-guide.md)

**Current State:**
- Identified load balancing as HIGHEST PRIORITY from Paradox analysis
- Unity's IJobParallelFor assumes uniform cost per item
- Heterogeneous workloads (player capitals vs AI backwaters) cause thread starvation

**Why Now:**
Victoria 3 learned this the hard way: expensive provinces clump on one thread while others idle. Implementing BEFORE building/economy systems = 10x cheaper than retrofitting.

---

## What We Did

### 1. LoadBalancedScheduler (ENGINE - Core/Jobs)
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Core/Jobs/LoadBalancedScheduler.cs:1-180` (new)

**Implementation:**
Generic mechanism for splitting heterogeneous workloads into balanced batches.

```csharp
namespace Core.Jobs
{
    public static class LoadBalancedScheduler
    {
        public struct WorkItem
        {
            public int index;           // Entity ID (province, country, etc.)
            public int estimatedCost;   // Cost heuristic (from caller)
        }

        // Split by fixed threshold
        public static (NativeArray<int> expensive, NativeArray<int> affordable)
            SplitByThreshold(
                NativeArray<WorkItem> items,
                int costThreshold,
                Allocator allocator)
        {
            // O(n) split - no sorting required
            // Returns two arrays: indices >= threshold, indices < threshold
        }

        // Split by percentile (adaptive)
        public static (NativeArray<int> expensive, NativeArray<int> affordable)
            SplitByPercentile(
                NativeArray<WorkItem> items,
                float percentile,
                Allocator allocator)
        {
            // Sorts by cost, finds Nth percentile threshold
            // Example: 0.9 = top 10% are "expensive"
        }

        // Helper: Calculate median threshold
        public static int CalculateMedianThreshold(NativeArray<WorkItem> items)
        {
            // Simple insertion sort, returns median
            // Good enough for heterogeneous split
        }
    }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Generic**: Works for provinces, countries, fleets - anything with cost variation
- **Simple**: O(n) split, no complex scheduling logic
- **Explicit**: Game code decides what "expensive" means
- **Battle-tested**: Victoria 3's proven pattern

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows engine-game-separation.md (MECHANISM in engine, POLICY in game)
- ✅ Uses NativeArray (zero allocations, Burst-compatible)
- ✅ Lives in Core/Jobs (correct namespace)

### 2. Cost Estimation (GAME - Game/Systems)
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/Systems/HegemonProvinceSystem.cs:351-426` (new section)

**Implementation:**
Game-specific policy for estimating province processing cost.

```csharp
public int EstimateProcessingCost(ushort provinceId)
{
    var data = hegemonData[provinceId];
    int cost = 0;

    // Weighted heuristic (will evolve as systems are added)
    cost += data.development * 10;  // Primary: economy complexity
    cost += data.fortLevel * 5;     // Military calculations
    cost += data.population * 3;    // Demographic systems
    cost += data.unrest * 2;        // Stability calculations
    cost += 1;                      // Base cost

    return cost;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Game decision**: Engine doesn't know what makes a province "expensive"
- **Heuristic**: Doesn't need to be perfect, just good enough to prevent thread starvation
- **Evolvable**: Weights adjust as new systems (trade, buildings) are added
- **Cheap**: Simple math, no iteration

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ GAME layer decides policy (what is "expensive")
- ✅ ENGINE provides mechanism (how to split work)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Stress Test (GAME - Game/Tests)
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/Tests/LoadBalancingStressTest.cs:1-340` (new)

**Implementation:**
Validates that load balancing actually improves performance with heterogeneous workloads.

```csharp
public class LoadBalancingStressTest : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Setup: 100 expensive provinces (dev=200, forts=50, pop=150)
    //        9900 cheap provinces (dev=10, forts=0, pop=5)
    // Result: 23:1 cost ratio

    float RunNaiveTest()
    {
        // Standard IJobParallelFor - no balancing
        // Unity scheduler assumes uniform cost
        // Problem: Expensive provinces cluster on one thread
    }

    float RunBalancedTest()
    {
        // Split expensive/affordable, schedule separately
        var (expensive, affordable) = LoadBalancedScheduler.SplitByThreshold(...);
        // Schedule both jobs in parallel with different batch sizes
    }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Real-world simulation**: Mimics player capitals (expensive) vs AI backwaters (cheap)
- **Measurable**: Direct timing comparison (naive vs balanced)
- **At scale**: Tests with actual game province count (10,000)
- **Self-contained**: Uses existing HegemonProvinceSystem from HegemonInitializer

**Test Results (10,000 provinces, 23:1 cost ratio):**
```
Naive (no balancing):     6.31ms
Balanced (split jobs):    4.74ms
Improvement:              24.9%
```

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Victoria 3 Pattern (Split Jobs)
**Context:** Multiple approaches for load balancing heterogeneous workloads

**Options Considered:**
1. **Sort by cost before dispatch** - Complex, cache-unfriendly, sorting overhead
2. **Split into expensive/affordable batches** - Simple, explicit, Victoria 3's approach
3. **Custom work-stealing scheduler** - Overkill, complex implementation

**Decision:** Option 2 (split jobs)

**Rationale:**
- Battle-tested by Paradox in Victoria 3 production
- Simple O(n) split, no sorting overhead
- Explicit control over thread distribution
- Easy to understand and debug

**Trade-offs:** Need to estimate costs (but heuristic is good enough)

**Documentation Impact:** Documented in this log, no architecture doc changes needed

### Decision 2: Cost Estimation Weights
**Context:** How to estimate province processing cost without implementing all systems

**Options Considered:**
1. **Equal weights** - Too simple, won't reflect real complexity
2. **Development-only** - Ignores military/population complexity
3. **Weighted sum** - Reflects relative system complexity

**Decision:** Weighted sum (development×10, forts×5, pop×3, unrest×2)

**Rationale:**
- Development = primary driver (economy, trade, buildings)
- Military systems (forts) = moderate cost
- Demographics/stability = lower cost
- Weights can evolve as systems are implemented

**Trade-offs:** Heuristic may need tuning, but results show it's effective

**Documentation Impact:** Documented in HegemonProvinceSystem code comments

### Decision 3: Test Uses HegemonInitializer System
**Context:** Stress test needs province data - create temp system or use existing?

**Options Considered:**
1. **Create temporary test systems** - Self-contained, complex initialization
2. **Use HegemonInitializer's system** - Simple, tests with real data

**Decision:** Option 2 (use existing system)

**Rationale:**
- Tests with actual loaded game data (more realistic)
- No complex initialization code in test
- Simpler, cleaner test implementation

**Trade-offs:** Must run in Play Mode after game initialization

## What Worked ✅

1. **Engine-Game Separation Pattern**
   - What: Engine provides mechanism (LoadBalancedScheduler), Game provides policy (cost estimation)
   - Why it worked: Clear separation of concerns, engine stays generic
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - apply to all engine infrastructure

2. **Victoria 3's Split-Job Pattern**
   - What: Separate "expensive" and "affordable" batches, schedule independently
   - Impact: 24.9% improvement at 10,000 provinces with 23:1 cost ratio
   - Why it worked: Spreads expensive items across threads, prevents clustering

3. **Simple Cost Heuristic**
   - What: Weighted sum of complexity indicators (no perfect calculation needed)
   - Why it worked: Good enough to prevent thread starvation (doesn't need to be perfect)
   - Impact: Effective with minimal code complexity

4. **Stress Test Validation**
   - What: Direct comparison (naive vs balanced) with heterogeneous workload
   - Why it worked: Measurable proof that pattern works at scale
   - Impact: Confidence in implementation before building game systems

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Initial Attempt: Self-Contained Test Systems**
   - What we tried: Test creates its own EventBus, ProvinceSystem, HegemonProvinceSystem
   - Why it failed: Complex initialization, required knowledge of internal dependencies
   - Lesson learned: Use existing initialized systems for tests (simpler, tests real data)
   - Don't try this again because: Unity systems aren't designed for arbitrary instantiation

2. **Manual Meta File Creation**
   - What we tried: Created LoadBalancedScheduler.cs.meta with placeholder GUID
   - Why it failed: Invalid hex characters (g, h, j, k, etc.) prevented Unity asset database from recognizing file
   - Lesson learned: Let Unity auto-generate meta files (delete and let Unity create)
   - Don't try this again because: Unity's GUID validation is strict, manual creation error-prone

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: LoadBalancedScheduler Type Not Found
**Symptom:** CS0246 errors - "The type or namespace name 'LoadBalancedScheduler' could not be found"

**Root Cause:** Invalid GUID in manually-created .meta file prevented Unity from registering the file

**Investigation:**
- Tried: Reimporting assets
- Tried: Checking assembly definitions (Core.asmdef)
- Tried: Removing managed delegate code (System.Func)
- Found: GUID had invalid hex characters (a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6)

**Solution:**
```bash
rm LoadBalancedScheduler.cs.meta
# Unity auto-generates valid GUID on next refresh
```

**Why This Works:** Unity's asset database requires valid hex GUIDs (0-9, a-f only)

**Pattern for Future:** Never manually create .meta files - always let Unity generate them

### Problem 2: Missing Unity.Jobs Reference
**Symptom:** Same CS0246 errors persisted after fixing GUID

**Root Cause:** Game.asmdef didn't reference Unity.Jobs package (needed for IJobParallelFor, JobHandle)

**Investigation:**
- Checked: Core.asmdef has Unity.Jobs (correct)
- Checked: Game.asmdef references Core (correct)
- Found: Game.asmdef missing Unity.Jobs reference

**Solution:**
```json
// Game.asmdef
"references": [
    "Core",
    "Unity.Collections",
    "Unity.Mathematics",
    "Unity.Jobs",  // Added this
    "Unity.Profiling.Core",
    "Unity.TextMeshPro"
]
```

**Why This Works:** Test file uses Unity.Jobs types directly (IJobParallelFor), needs direct reference

**Pattern for Future:** Check assembly dependencies when adding new test infrastructure

### Problem 3: ReadOnly Attribute Ambiguity
**Symptom:** CS0104 - 'ReadOnly' is ambiguous between 'Unity.Collections.ReadOnlyAttribute' and 'Core.ReadOnlyAttribute'

**Root Cause:** Both Unity.Collections and Core namespaces define ReadOnly attribute

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Before
[ReadOnly] public NativeArray<int> indices;

// After
[Unity.Collections.ReadOnly] public NativeArray<int> indices;
```

**Why This Works:** Fully qualified name removes ambiguity

**Pattern for Future:** Use fully qualified attributes when multiple namespaces imported

---

## Architecture Impact

### Documentation Updates Required
- [x] Created this log document
- [ ] Consider adding load balancing example to performance-architecture-guide.md (optional)

### New Patterns Discovered
**Pattern:** Cost-Based Job Splitting (Victoria 3)
- When to use: Heterogeneous workloads with variable processing cost (provinces, countries, fleets)
- Benefits: Prevents thread starvation, 20-30% improvement with high cost variance
- How it works:
  1. Game estimates cost per item (heuristic)
  2. Engine splits into expensive/affordable batches (median threshold)
  3. Schedule separately with different batch sizes
  4. All threads stay busy
- Add to: Already documented in this log

**Anti-Pattern:** Manual Meta File Creation
- What not to do: Create .meta files by hand with placeholder GUIDs
- Why it's bad: Unity requires valid hex GUIDs, manual creation error-prone
- How to avoid: Always delete and let Unity regenerate
- Add warning to: Internal notes

### Load Balancing Status Changed
**Changed:** Load balancing infrastructure status
**From:** ❌ Not implemented (from session 1 planning)
**To:** ✅ Implemented and validated (24.9% improvement)
**Scope:** All systems that process heterogeneous collections
**Reason:** Highest priority from Paradox analysis, foundation for game systems

## Next Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Commit load balancing infrastructure** - Working code ready for production
2. **UI Data Access (snapshots)** - Next priority from Paradox analysis
3. **Document pre-allocation policy** - Medium priority, can run in parallel

### Blocked Items
None - all priorities can proceed independently

### Questions to Resolve
1. Should cost estimation weights be tunable/configurable? (Probably not - keep simple)
2. Need thread utilization profiling in Unity Profiler? (Nice to have, not blocking)
3. Should LoadBalancedScheduler support dynamic threshold calculation? (Current median approach is good enough)

## Notes & Observations

**The Big Win:**
Implementing load balancing BEFORE building/economy systems = 10x cheaper than retrofitting. Victoria 3 had to add this later, causing massive refactoring. We designed it right from day 1.

**Cost Estimation Philosophy:**
Heuristic doesn't need to be perfect - just good enough to prevent thread starvation. 23:1 cost ratio → 24.9% improvement proves the pattern works. Weights can evolve as systems are added.

**Engine-Game Separation Validated:**
Clean separation works beautifully. Engine provides generic mechanism (split by threshold), Game decides policy (what is "expensive"). Pattern applies to all infrastructure.

**Victoria 3 Pattern Proven:**
Split-job approach is simple, explicit, and measurably effective. No need for complex work-stealing schedulers. Battle-tested pattern from production game engine.

**Next Priority Clear:**
UI data access (snapshots) is next highest priority. Load balancing infrastructure is complete and validated. Foundation ready for game systems.
