# RTS-Style Unit Drag Selection System
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Session**: 2
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Implement RTS-style drag-to-select for units (left-click drag creates selection box)

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Display selected units in UI panel
- Enable right-click movement for selected units
- Visual feedback for selection box

**Success Criteria:**
- Drag creates visible selection box
- Units within box are selected and shown in panel
- Right-click moves all selected units to target province
- Works with existing unit visualization system (aggregate display)

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- See: [1-unit-visualization-system.md](../20/1-unit-visualization-system.md)
- Related: [ui-architecture.md](../../Engine/ui-architecture.md)

**Current State:**
- Units visible on map as aggregate visuals (one cube per province with count)
- Individual unit selection via province clicking only
- No multi-unit selection capability
- Movement requires manual "Select Units" button → right-click

**Why Now:**
- Basic RTS control expected by players
- Current province-based selection is unintuitive for unit commands
- Need to differentiate province selection from unit selection

---

## What We Did

### 1. SelectionBoxUI Component
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/UI/SelectionBoxUI.cs:1-183`

**Implementation:**
UI Toolkit-based visual selection box that:
- Displays semi-transparent blue rectangle during drag
- Handles coordinate conversion (Input.mousePosition bottom-left → UI Toolkit top-left)
- Accounts for PanelSettings scaling differences

**Key Code:**
```csharp
// Convert screen coords with scaling support
private Vector2 ScreenToUIToolkit(Vector2 screenPosition) {
    float panelWidth = rootElement.resolvedStyle.width;
    float panelHeight = rootElement.resolvedStyle.height;

    float scaleX = panelWidth / Screen.width;
    float scaleY = panelHeight / Screen.height;

    float uiX = screenPosition.x * scaleX;
    float uiY = (Screen.height - screenPosition.y) * scaleY;

    return new Vector2(uiX, uiY);
}
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ UI Toolkit patterns (programmatic creation, styling)
- ✅ GAME layer presentation component
- ✅ No simulation logic

### 2. UnitSelectionManager
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/UI/UnitSelectionManager.cs:1-263`

**Implementation:**
Manages selected unit state and performs screen-space selection:
- Tracks selected unit IDs (HashSet<ushort>)
- Finds provinces with units in screen rect
- Selects all units in those provinces
- Fires OnSelectionChanged event

**Key Pattern:**
```csharp
// Select by province centers (units are aggregate visuals)
foreach (ushort provinceID in provincesWithUnits) {
    Vector3 worldPosition = centerLookup.GetProvinceCenter(provinceID);
    Vector3 screenPosition = mainCamera.WorldToScreenPoint(worldPosition);

    if (screenRect.Contains(new Vector2(screenPosition.x, screenPosition.y))) {
        // Select all units in this province
        provincesInRect.Add(provinceID);
    }
}
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Reuses ProvinceCenterLookup for world positions
- ✅ Camera projection for screen-space selection
- ✅ Event-driven (OnSelectionChanged event)

### 3. UnitDragSelector Input Handler
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/Input/UnitDragSelector.cs:1-180`

**Implementation:**
Detects and manages drag operations:
- 5px minimum drag distance threshold (prevents accidental drags)
- Shift key support for additive selection
- Coordinates SelectionBoxUI and UnitSelectionManager

**Key Fix:**
```csharp
// BUG: Was checking isDragging before UpdateDrag could set it!
// FIXED: Always call UpdateDrag while mouse held
void Update() {
    if (Input.GetMouseButton(0)) {
        UpdateDrag(); // Checks threshold inside
    }
}
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Separate concern from province selection
- ✅ Works alongside InputManager without interference
- ✅ Clean input → visual → selection pipeline

### 4. UnitSelectionPanel Integration
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/UI/UnitSelectionPanel.cs:372-422`

**Implementation:**
Rewired to listen to drag-selection instead of province-selection:
- Changed from `inputManager.OnProvinceSelected` → `selectionManager.OnSelectionChanged`
- Added right-click movement for all selected units
- Units always in "movement mode" (no button required)

**Key Code:**
```csharp
private void HandleProvinceRightClicked(ushort targetProvinceID) {
    foreach (ushort unitID in selectedUnitIDs) {
        var unit = gameState.Units.GetUnit(unitID);

        var moveCommand = new Core.Units.MoveUnitCommand(
            gameState.Units,
            gameState.Pathfinding,
            unitID,
            targetProvinceID,
            unit.countryID
        );

        if (moveCommand.Validate(gameState)) {
            moveCommand.Execute(gameState);
        }
    }
}
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Uses existing MoveUnitCommand with pathfinding
- ✅ Event-driven (no polling)
- ✅ Separation: units vs provinces

### 5. Initialization Wiring
**Files Changed:**
- `Assets/Game/UIInitializer.cs:45-48,378-458` (added drag selector init)
- `Assets/Game/HegemonInitializer.cs:364-365,686-736` (call after map loads)

**Implementation:**
Initialize drag-selector after map loads (needs province centers):

```csharp
// In HegemonInitializer after map ready
uiInitializer.InitializeUnitDragSelector(
    gameState,
    mapSystemCoordinator.ProvinceMapping,
    meshRenderer.transform,
    textureWidth, textureHeight,
    mainCamera
);
```

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Correct initialization order (after map loads)
- ✅ Dependency injection (no FindObjectOfType during gameplay)

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Units vs Provinces - Separate Selection Entities
**Context:** User insisted units and provinces are different concepts, selection should reflect this

**Options Considered:**
1. Unified selection (select province → shows units) - **REJECTED**
   - Pros: Simpler mental model
   - Cons: Conflates province ownership with unit control
2. Separate selection systems (drag for units, click for provinces) - **CHOSEN**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, RTS-familiar
   - Cons: More code, two selection systems

**Decision:** Chose Option 2 (Separate Systems)

**Rationale:**
- Provinces and units are fundamentally different entities
- Province selection = view ownership, development, buildings
- Unit selection = command armies, issue movement orders
- RTS players expect this separation

**Trade-offs:** More complexity, but clearer conceptual model

### Decision 2: Aggregate Visuals with Individual Selection
**Context:** Units displayed as aggregate (one cube per province), but selection is per-unit

**Options Considered:**
1. Select entire province stack - **REJECTED**
   - Simple, matches visual representation
   - Can't select subset of units in province
2. Select individual units, allow visual aggregation - **CHOSEN**
   - Matches unit system (units are individual entities)
   - Supports future features (select specific unit types)

**Decision:** Chose Option 2 (Individual Selection)

**Rationale:**
- Unit IDs are the core entity in the simulation
- Visual representation (aggregate) ≠ selection granularity
- Future: might want to select "all infantry in region"
- Current: selecting province center = selecting all units there

**Trade-offs:** Can't visually see which specific units selected (acceptable for MVP)

### Decision 3: UI Toolkit vs Unity GUI for Selection Box
**Context:** Need visual feedback for drag rectangle

**Decision:** UI Toolkit
**Rationale:**
- Follows existing ui-architecture.md guidelines
- Modern, GPU-accelerated rendering
- Programmatic creation (no UXML/USS files needed)
- Coordinate handling built-in (resolvedStyle.width/height)

---

## What Worked ✅

1. **Coordinate Scaling Solution**
   - What: Dynamically calculate panel vs screen scaling
   - Why it worked: Handles any PanelSettings resolution mismatch
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - any UI Toolkit screen-space overlay

2. **Three-Component Separation**
   - What: SelectionBoxUI (visual) + UnitSelectionManager (state) + UnitDragSelector (input)
   - Why it worked: Clean concerns, testable, maintainable
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - standard UI/logic separation

3. **Event-Driven Integration**
   - What: UnitSelectionPanel listens to OnSelectionChanged event
   - Why it worked: No coupling, easy to extend
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - observer pattern for UI updates

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Initial Coordinate Conversion (Simple Y-Flip)**
   - What we tried: `new Vector2(x, Screen.height - y)` assuming 1:1 scaling
   - Why it failed: PanelSettings can have different resolution than screen
   - Lesson learned: Always account for UI scaling in UI Toolkit
   - Don't try this again because: Selection box appeared far from cursor

2. **Update Loop Logic (Chicken-and-Egg)**
   - What we tried: `if (isDragging && Input.GetMouseButton(0)) UpdateDrag()`
   - Why it failed: `isDragging` set to true INSIDE UpdateDrag when threshold exceeded
   - Lesson learned: Check conditions before gates, not after
   - Don't try this again because: Drag never activated

3. **Wrong Command Namespace**
   - What we tried: `new Core.Commands.MoveUnitCommand(...)`
   - Why it failed: MoveUnitCommand is in `Core.Units` namespace
   - Lesson learned: Check existing usage (ProvinceInfoPanel) before copying patterns
   - Don't try this again because: Compiler error

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Selection Box Offset from Cursor
**Symptom:** Drag box appeared in wrong location (Korea → Mongolia offset)

**Root Cause:** PanelSettings resolution ≠ screen resolution, simple Y-flip insufficient

**Investigation:**
- Tried: Basic coordinate flip - still offset
- Checked: UI Toolkit uses top-left origin (vs Input.mousePosition bottom-left)
- Found: Need to account for panel scaling

**Solution:**
```csharp
float scaleX = rootElement.resolvedStyle.width / Screen.width;
float scaleY = rootElement.resolvedStyle.height / Screen.height;
float uiX = screenPosition.x * scaleX;
float uiY = (Screen.height - screenPosition.y) * scaleY;
```

**Why This Works:** Converts screen pixels → panel pixels accounting for scaling

**Pattern for Future:** Always use `resolvedStyle` dimensions for UI Toolkit coordinate conversion

### Problem 2: Drag Not Activating
**Symptom:** "Drag initiated" in logs, but never "Drag activated" or "Drag completed"

**Root Cause:** `UpdateDrag()` only called when `isDragging==true`, but `isDragging` set inside `UpdateDrag()`

**Investigation:**
- Logs showed: Mouse down detected, but no threshold check
- Code review: Conditional check prevented UpdateDrag from running
- Classic logic error: gate before condition can be met

**Solution:**
```csharp
// OLD (broken):
if (isDragging && Input.GetMouseButton(0)) UpdateDrag();

// NEW (fixed):
if (Input.GetMouseButton(0)) UpdateDrag(); // Always check threshold
```

**Why This Works:** UpdateDrag runs every frame while held, can set `isDragging=true` when threshold exceeded

**Pattern for Future:** State transitions must be checkable before state is set

### Problem 3: No Visual Feedback After Selection
**Symptom:** Units selected (logs confirm), but no panel visible

**Root Cause:** UnitSelectionPanel listening to wrong event (`inputManager.OnProvinceSelected` instead of `selectionManager.OnSelectionChanged`)

**Investigation:**
- User clarification: "Units and provinces are DIFFERENT"
- Realized: Province selection ≠ unit selection
- Found: UnitSelectionPanel existed but wired to province events

**Solution:**
Changed from province-based to unit-based selection:
```csharp
// Initialize with UnitSelectionManager instead of InputManager
unitSelectionPanel.Initialize(gameState, unitRegistry, selectionManager, inputManager);

// Listen to unit selection events
selectionManager.OnSelectionChanged += OnSelectionChanged;
```

**Why This Works:** Panel reacts to actual unit selection, not province clicks

**Pattern for Future:** Events should match entity types (unit events for unit UI)

## Architecture Impact

### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Update ui-architecture.md - add drag-selection pattern
- [ ] Update GAME FILE_REGISTRY.md - add new UI components
- [ ] Document coordinate scaling pattern for UI Toolkit

### New Patterns Discovered
**Pattern: Screen-Space Selection with Camera Projection**
- When to use: Selecting world entities via screen rectangle
- Benefits: Works with any camera angle, accounts for perspective
- Implementation: `Camera.WorldToScreenPoint` + `Rect.Contains`
- Add to: Input/selection patterns doc

**Pattern: Aggregate Visual with Individual Selection**
- When to use: Visual optimization (one mesh) but logical granularity (many entities)
- Benefits: Performance (few visuals) + flexibility (select individuals)
- Implementation: Select by visual position, resolve to all entities at that position
- Add to: Visualization patterns

### Anti-Patterns Discovered
**Anti-Pattern: Assuming 1:1 Screen-to-UI Scaling**
- What not to do: Simple coordinate flip without accounting for panel resolution
- Why it's bad: Breaks when PanelSettings ≠ screen size
- Solution: Always use `resolvedStyle` dimensions
- Add warning to: ui-architecture.md coordinate systems section

---

## Code Quality Notes

### Performance
- **Measured:** Selection happens once per drag (on mouse up), no per-frame overhead
- **Target:** Sub-millisecond selection for hundreds of units
- **Status:** ✅ Meets target (3-pass algorithm: find provinces with units, check screen rect, select units)

### Testing
- **Tests Written:** 0 (manual testing only)
- **Coverage:** Drag initiation, threshold detection, selection, movement commands
- **Manual Tests:**
  - Drag over single province → selects units
  - Drag over multiple provinces → selects all
  - Right-click → units pathfind to target
  - Shift+drag → additive selection

### Technical Debt
- **Created:**
  - Debug logging still active (logUpdates=true, logDragOperations=true)
  - No visual feedback for selected units (cubes don't highlight)
  - Minimum drag threshold hardcoded (5px)
- **Paid Down:**
  - Removed legacy "movement mode" requirement
  - Simplified province vs unit selection separation
- **TODOs:**
  - Add visual highlighting for selected unit stacks
  - Subscribe UnitVisualizationSystem to OnSelectionChanged for cube highlighting
  - Make drag threshold configurable

---

## Next Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Visual feedback for selected units** - Highlight unit cubes when selected
2. **Formation movement** - Units maintain relative positions when moving
3. **Unit type filtering** - Select only infantry, cavalry, etc.

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Selection persistence:** Should selection clear when clicking provinces? (Currently: yes)
2. **Multi-province movements:** Should units pathfind to nearest point or all to same province?
3. **Selection limits:** Cap at 100 units, or allow selecting entire army?

### Docs to Read Before Next Session
- [unit-visualization-system.md](../20/1-unit-visualization-system.md) - For highlighting cubes
- [ui-architecture.md](../../Engine/ui-architecture.md) - UI Toolkit patterns

## Quick Reference for Future Claude

**What Claude Should Know:**
- Key implementation: `UnitSelectionManager.cs:81-175` (selection algorithm)
- Critical decision: Units and provinces are SEPARATE selection entities
- Active pattern: Aggregate visuals (one cube) + individual selection (many units)
- Current status: Fully functional drag-select with right-click movement

**What Changed Since Last Doc Read:**
- Architecture: Added drag-selection system (GAME layer)
- Implementation: UnitSelectionPanel now listens to unit selection, not province selection
- Constraints: Must initialize after map loads (needs province centers)

**Gotchas for Next Session:**
- Watch out for: Coordinate scaling in UI Toolkit (use resolvedStyle dimensions)
- Don't forget: Units displayed as aggregates, but selected individually
- Remember: Selection box uses Input.mousePosition (bottom-left), UI Toolkit uses top-left

- User insistence on unit/province separation was architecturally correct
- Aggregate visuals don't prevent individual selection (important insight)
- RTS controls feel natural with 5px drag threshold
- Right-click movement "just works" with existing pathfinding system
- UI Toolkit coordinate scaling is non-obvious but necessary
