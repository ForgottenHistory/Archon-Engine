# Mesh-Based Border Rendering - Abandoning Distance Fields
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Session**: 1
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Borders rendering with flat caps
**Priority**: High

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Replace distance field border rendering with mesh-based quad rendering to eliminate round caps

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Achieve Imperator Rome quality borders (smooth curves, flat caps, consistent thickness)
- Maintain Chaikin smoothing (correct shape following province boundaries)
- Handle Unity's 65k vertex limit for large-scale maps

**Success Criteria:**
- Borders render across entire map with NO round caps
- Smooth curves following province boundaries
- Resolution independent rendering

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- Sessions 1-4 (Oct 28): Tried distance field rendering, BorderMask threshold experiments, junction detection
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Distance fields inherently create round caps at endpoints (mathematical limitation)
- All attempts to fix round caps failed: endpoint penalties, directional culling, connectivity flags

**Current State:**
- Chaikin smoothing creates perfect smooth curves following province boundaries
- Distance field evaluation creates unwanted round caps at every segment endpoint
- User: "this sounds like a MAJOR OVERSIGHT. This is not going to fly my man"

**Why Now:**
- After exhausting distance field approaches, need architectural pivot
- User showed Imperator Rome screenshot - likely uses mesh-based rendering
- Industry best practice: Pre-generate geometry, not per-pixel distance evaluation

---

## What We Did

### 1. Created BorderMeshGenerator - Polyline to Quad Mesh Conversion
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs` (new file)

**Implementation:**
Converts Chaikin-smoothed polylines into renderable quad meshes:

```csharp
// For each line segment P0→P1:
Vector2 dir = (p1 - p0).normalized;
Vector2 perp = new Vector2(-dir.y, dir.x) * borderWidth * 0.5f;

// Generate 4 vertices forming a quad
verts.Add(new Vector3(x0 - perpX, 0.01f, z0 - perpZ)); // Bottom-left
verts.Add(new Vector3(x0 + perpX, 0.01f, z0 + perpZ)); // Top-left
verts.Add(new Vector3(x1 + perpX, 0.01f, z1 + perpZ)); // Top-right
verts.Add(new Vector3(x1 - perpX, 0.01f, z1 - perpZ)); // Bottom-right

// 2 triangles per segment
tris.Add(baseIndex + 0, baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2);
tris.Add(baseIndex + 0, baseIndex + 2, baseIndex + 3);
```

**Key Features:**
- Perpendicular extrusion creates consistent border width
- **Flat caps by design** - quads end exactly at P0/P1 endpoints
- Separate meshes for province vs country borders
- Vertex colors for styling

**Rationale:**
- Standard triangle rasterization = what GPUs are built for
- No distance field math = no round caps possible
- Matches Imperator Rome approach (confirmed by screenshot analysis)

### 2. Created BorderMeshRenderer - Graphics.DrawMesh Rendering
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshRenderer.cs` (new file)

**Implementation:**
```csharp
void Update()
{
    foreach (var mesh in provinceBorderMeshes)
    {
        Graphics.DrawMesh(mesh, mapPlaneTransform.localToWorldMatrix,
            borderMaterial, layer, camera);
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- No GameObject in scene hierarchy
- Single draw call per mesh (efficient batching)
- URP-compatible unlit vertex color shader
- Transforms match map plane (position, rotation, scale)

**Rationale:**
- `Graphics.DrawMesh` = direct GPU rendering without GameObject overhead
- Map plane transform handles all coordinate mapping automatically

### 3. Fixed Coordinate Mapping - Pixel Space to Unity World Space
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:122-138`

**Problem:** Mesh vertices in pixel coordinates (0-5632, 0-2048) but Unity plane is 10x10 units scaled by (27.5, 1, 10)

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Convert pixels to Unity's default plane coordinate space (-5 to +5)
float x = (pixelX / mapWidth) * 10f - 5f;
float z = (pixelY / mapHeight) * 10f - 5f;

// Flip X axis to match texture orientation
x = 5f - x;
```

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Borders rendering but at wrong positions → coordinate space mismatch
2. User found borders at (0,0,0) → normalization working but not scaled
3. Tried -0.5 to 0.5 range → too small, Unity plane is -5 to +5
4. User: "I think it's flipped on X" → X-axis flip aligned borders perfectly

### 4. Handled Unity's 65k Vertex Limit - Multi-Mesh Splitting
**Files Changed:** `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:160-220`

**Problem:** Province borders = 226,240 vertices, Unity limit = 65,535 per mesh

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Split into multiple meshes
const int MAX_VERTICES = 65000;
while (offset < totalVertices)
{
    int chunkSize = Math.Min(MAX_VERTICES, remaining);
    var mesh = CreateMesh(verts.GetRange(offset, chunkSize), ...);
    meshes.Add(mesh);
    offset += chunkSize;
}
// Result: 4 province meshes, 1 country mesh
```

**User Observation:** "I notice only maybe 1/4 of the world actually has borders though"
**Root Cause:** Only first 65k vertices rendering, rest discarded
**Result:** 226k vertices split into 4 meshes, all borders now render

### 5. Created URP-Compatible Border Shader
**Files Changed:** `BorderMesh.shader` (new file)

**Implementation:**
```hlsl
Pass {
    Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha
    ZWrite Off
    Cull Off

    half4 frag(Varyings input) : SV_Target {
        return input.color; // Vertex color passthrough
    }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Built-in `Internal-Colored` shader doesn't exist in URP
- Simple unlit vertex color shader for flat-shaded borders
- Transparent blend mode for proper layering

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Mesh-Based Rendering vs Distance Fields
**Context:** After 4 sessions, distance fields fundamentally incompatible with flat caps

**Options Considered:**
1. **Keep trying distance field workarounds** - Directional culling, connectivity logic, etc.
2. **Geometry shader line extrusion** - Convert lines to quads on GPU
3. **CPU pre-generated quad meshes** - Convert at startup, render as standard geometry

**Decision:** Chose Option 3 (CPU quad meshes)

**Rationale:**
- Geometry shaders = slow, platform limitations (no mobile/Mac), 30fps→5fps drops reported
- Pre-generated meshes = industry standard (Imperator Rome, CK3, vector graphics APIs)
- Flat caps by design (quads end at endpoints, no extension)
- GPU rasterization = what GPUs are built for

**Trade-offs:**
- ~20ms startup cost for mesh generation (acceptable)
- 5MB memory for mesh data (acceptable for 63k segments)
- **Eliminates:** Round cap problem, per-pixel distance calculations, geometry shader overhead

### Decision 2: Multiple Small Meshes vs Single Large Mesh
**Context:** Unity's 65k vertex limit requires splitting large border sets

**Options Considered:**
1. **Use 32-bit index buffer** - Increase limit to 4 billion vertices
2. **Split into grid-based chunks** - Spatial partitioning
3. **Split by vertex count** - Simple linear chunking

**Decision:** Chose Option 3 (Linear chunking at 65k boundary)

**Rationale:**
- 32-bit indices require mesh.indexFormat = IndexFormat.UInt32 (more complex)
- Spatial chunking adds complexity with no benefit for `Graphics.DrawMesh`
- Linear split = simple, works with any mesh size

**Trade-offs:**
- 4 draw calls vs 1 (acceptable - modern GPUs handle this fine)
- Simple implementation, easy to debug

---

## What Worked ✅

1. **Perpendicular Quad Extrusion**
   - What: Calculate perpendicular direction, extrude thin quads along line segments
   - Why it worked: Standard graphics technique, GPU rasterizes triangles natively
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - this is how all vector line rendering works

2. **Map Plane Transform Matching**
   - What: Use `mapPlaneTransform.localToWorldMatrix` for border mesh transform
   - Why it worked: Automatically handles position, rotation, AND scale
   - Impact: Borders align perfectly with map regardless of scale/position

3. **X-Axis Flip for Texture Coordinate Alignment**
   - What: `x = 5f - (pixelX / mapWidth) * 10f`
   - Why it worked: Texture U coordinate vs world X coordinate have different origins
   - Pattern: Common issue when converting 2D texture coords to 3D world space

4. **Multi-Mesh Splitting**
   - What: Split large vertex arrays into 65k chunks
   - Why it worked: Each chunk fits Unity's limit, GPU batches draw calls efficiently
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - any large-scale mesh rendering needs this

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Graphics.DrawMesh with Identity Transform**
   - What we tried: `Matrix4x4.identity` for border mesh transform
   - Why it failed: Mesh at 10x10 scale, map plane at 275x10 scale → invisible tiny borders
   - Lesson learned: Must match map plane's transform exactly
   - Don't try this again because: Ignores map plane's scaling

2. **Generating Vertices at Y=0**
   - What we tried: Border vertices at same height as map plane (Y=0)
   - Why it failed: Borders render INSIDE the map plane mesh, invisible
   - Lesson learned: Need slight height offset (Y=0.01) to render above terrain
   - Don't try this again because: Z-fighting and occlusion

3. **Normalized 0-1 Coordinate Space**
   - What we tried: `x = (pixelX / mapWidth) - 0.5f` for -0.5 to +0.5 range
   - Why it failed: Unity's default plane is -5 to +5, not -0.5 to +0.5
   - Lesson learned: Unity plane is 10 units square, must match that range
   - Don't try this again because: Wrong scale by factor of 10

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Borders Not Visible After Initial Implementation
**Symptom:** Mesh generated successfully (226k vertices), material created, but nothing visible

**Root Cause:** Multiple issues:
1. Vertices at Y=0 (inside map plane)
2. Coordinates in pixel space (0-5632) not Unity space (-5 to +5)
3. Transform not matching map plane

**Investigation:**
- Logs showed: "First render - Province mesh: True (226240 verts)" → meshes exist
- Logs showed: "Material: BorderMeshMaterial, Shader: Archon/BorderMesh" → material works
- User looked around map, found borders at (0,0,0) → normalization working but wrong scale

**Solution:**
```csharp
// 1. Height offset
float borderHeight = 0.01f;

// 2. Convert to -5 to +5 range (Unity plane coordinates)
float x = (pixelX / mapWidth) * 10f - 5f;

// 3. Use map plane transform
Matrix4x4 transform = mapPlaneTransform.localToWorldMatrix;
```

**Why This Works:** Matches Unity's coordinate system exactly

**Pattern for Future:** When rendering overlays on Unity planes, always match their transform and use height offset

### Problem 2: Borders in Wrong Positions (Random/Flipped)
**Symptom:** User: "I see weird borders all over the map. They don't match any province/country at all"

**Root Cause:** Texture coordinate space vs world space axis flip

**Investigation:**
- User: "I think it's flipped on X" → Tried X-axis flip
- Result: Borders aligned perfectly with provinces

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Flip X axis to match texture orientation
float x = 5f - (pixelX / mapWidth) * 10f;
```

**Why This Works:** Texture U coordinate (0 at left) maps to world X (5 at left in Unity's coordinate system after scaling)

**Pattern for Future:** Always verify axis orientations when converting texture coords to world space

### Problem 3: Only 1/4 of Borders Rendering
**Symptom:** User: "only maybe 1/4 of the world actually has borders though"

**Root Cause:** Unity's 65,535 vertex limit per mesh, province borders = 226,240 vertices

**Investigation:**
- Checked logs: "226240 vertices" → Exceeds 65k limit by 3.5x
- Unity silently truncates mesh data beyond 65k
- 226k / 65k ≈ 1/4 visible borders

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Split into multiple meshes
const int MAX_VERTICES = 65000;
List<Mesh> meshes = new List<Mesh>();
while (offset < vertices.Count) {
    int chunk = Min(MAX_VERTICES, remaining);
    meshes.Add(CreateMesh(vertices.GetRange(offset, chunk)));
    offset += chunk;
}
// Render all meshes
foreach (var mesh in meshes) Graphics.DrawMesh(mesh, ...);
```

**Result:** "Province borders: 226240 vertices in 4 meshes" - all borders render

**Why This Works:** Each mesh stays within Unity's limit, GPU batches draw calls

**Pattern for Future:** Always check vertex counts for large-scale maps, split meshes preemptively

## Code Quality Notes

### Performance
- **Measured:**
  - Mesh generation: 20.2ms at startup
  - Province borders: 226,240 vertices, 113,120 triangles in 4 meshes
  - Country borders: 26,808 vertices, 13,404 triangles in 1 mesh
- **Runtime:** 5 draw calls total per frame (4 province + 1 country)
- **Status:** ✅ Meets target (single-digit draw calls, <50ms startup)

### Testing
- **Manual Tests:**
  - Visual verification: Borders render across entire map
  - Coordinate alignment: Borders match province boundaries
  - Flat caps: No round blobs at segment endpoints
- **Remaining:** Test border styling (colors, thickness variations)

### Technical Debt
- **Created:**
  - Distance field rendering code still exists (SDF mode)
  - Junction handling not yet implemented (tiny gaps at 3-way meetings)
- **TODOs:**
  - Test border colors and styling
  - Add miter joins at junctions (optional, gaps may be invisible)
  - Consider cleanup of old SDF rendering code

---

## Next Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Test border styling** - Verify colors, thickness, visibility work correctly
2. **Evaluate junction gaps** - Are tiny gaps at junctions visually acceptable?
3. **If needed: Add miter joins** - Extend quads to meet at junction corners

### Blocked Items
None - core rendering working

### Questions to Resolve
1. Are junction gaps noticeable at gameplay zoom? (May be acceptable as-is)
2. Do border colors need separate materials or can vertex colors handle it?
3. Should we delete SDF rendering code or keep as fallback?

## Quick Reference for Future Claude

**What Claude Should Know:**
- Mesh-based rendering is THE solution (distance fields abandoned)
- Borders = pre-generated quad meshes from Chaikin polylines
- **Flat caps by design** - quads end at endpoints, no round caps possible
- Multiple meshes required due to 65k vertex limit
- X-axis flip needed for coordinate alignment

**Key Implementation:**
- Mesh generation: `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:115-145`
- Rendering: `BorderMeshRenderer.cs:80-110`
- Coordinate mapping: `BorderMeshGenerator.cs:122-138`

**What Changed Since Last Session:**
- Architecture: Distance fields → Mesh-based rendering
- Round caps: Mathematical problem → Solved by design
- Rendering: Fragment shader per-pixel → Standard triangle rasterization
- Performance: Per-pixel expensive → Pre-generated efficient

**Gotchas for Next Session:**
- Remember: X-axis flip required (`x = 5f - normalized`)
- Don't forget: Y offset (0.01) needed to render above map
- Watch out for: 65k vertex limit on any new features

## Notes & Observations

**User Insights:**
- "65,535 vertices per mesh, yeah that's way too low for a grand strategy map" - Correctly identified Unity limitation
- "I think it's flipped on X" - Perfect debugging intuition for coordinate flip
- "only maybe 1/4 of the world actually has borders" - Observation led to discovering vertex limit issue

**The Journey:**
- Started session with "we need to rethink this" after 4 sessions of distance field attempts
- User confirmed: "Chaikin smoothing creates the desired shape, follows province borders but has a slight curve"
- Analyzed Imperator Rome screenshot → confirmed mesh-based approach
- Multiple coordinate system fixes before finding correct mapping
- Unity's 65k limit caught us by surprise but easy to fix

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Borders render across entire map
- ✅ Smooth curves following province boundaries (Chaikin preserved)
- ✅ NO round caps (flat by design)
- ✅ Resolution independent (meshes scale with map plane)

**Next Steps:**
Still need to test styling, but core architecture problem SOLVED. Mesh-based rendering is the right approach.
