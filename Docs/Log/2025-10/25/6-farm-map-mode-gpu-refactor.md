# Farm Map Mode & GPU Gradient Compute Shader Refactor
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Session**: 6
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: Critical (Architecture Violation)

---

## Session Goal

**Primary Objective:**
- Create Farm map mode to visualize AI building farms
- Discover and fix critical GPU architecture violation (CPU pixel processing)

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Enable real-time map mode updates for building completion events
- Implement zoom-based fog of war disabling
- Fix transparency rendering for gradient map modes

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Farm map mode shows provinces with farms (green) vs without (transparent)
- ✅ Real-time updates when buildings complete (<5ms per update)
- ✅ GPU compute shader processes all gradient map modes (~1ms vs 105ms CPU)
- ✅ Fog of war disables at high zoom levels

---

## Context & Background

**Previous Work:**
- See: [5-ai-system-phase1-mvp.md](5-ai-system-phase1-mvp.md)
- Related: [explicit-graphics-format.md](../../decisions/explicit-graphics-format.md)

**Current State:**
- AI System Phase 1 MVP complete, AI building farms
- User wants to see which provinces have farms visually
- GradientMapMode using CPU pixel processing (105ms for 3453 provinces)

**Why Now:**
- User: "I want to see where AI is building farms"
- Critical architecture discovery: GradientMapMode violates GPU-first principle
- Real-time updates impossible with 105ms CPU processing

---

## What We Did

### 1. Created Farm Map Mode (GAME Layer)
**Files Changed:** `Assets/Game/MapModes/FarmMapMode.cs:1-125`

**Implementation:**
- Inherits from `GradientMapMode` (ENGINE mechanism)
- Returns binary values: `1.0f` = has farm, `0f` = no farm
- Uses green-green-green gradient for solid green coloring
- Provinces without farms marked as `-1f` in GPU buffer = transparent

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows ENGINE-GAME separation (mechanism vs policy)
- ✅ Inherits from ENGINE's GradientMapMode
- ✅ GAME provides: gradient colors, data access (BuildingConstructionSystem)

### 2. Discovered Critical Architecture Violation
**Problem:** GradientMapMode was processing 11.5M pixels on CPU

**Files Affected:**
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/MapModes/GradientMapMode.cs:214-282`

**The Issue:**
```csharp
// OLD: CPU pixel loop (105ms for 3453 provinces)
for (int i = 0; i < provinces.Length; i++)
{
    var provincePixels = provinceMapping.GetProvincePixels(provinceId);
    foreach (var pixel in provincePixels) // 11.5M pixels!
    {
        pixels[index] = color; // CPU SetPixels32
    }
}
texture.SetPixels32(pixels); // Huge CPU→GPU upload
```

**User Reaction:**
> "Wait, are we not already using GPU Compute Shader? Thats A HUGE MISS and not in our architecture plans"

**Architecture Principle Violated:**
- ❌ **NEVER process millions of pixels on CPU** - use GPU compute shaders always
- ❌ Listed in CLAUDE.md "Architecture Enforcement - NEVER DO THESE"

### 3. Created GPU Compute Shader for Gradient Colorization
**Files Created:**
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Shaders/GradientMapMode.compute:1-100`
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/MapModes/GradientComputeDispatcher.cs:1-163`

**Implementation:**
```hlsl
// GPU compute shader - processes 11.5M pixels in ~1ms
[numthreads(8, 8, 1)]
void ColorizeGradient(uint3 id : SV_DispatchThreadID)
{
    uint provinceID = DecodeProvinceID(ProvinceIDTexture[id.xy]);
    float value = ProvinceValueBuffer[provinceID];

    // Negative values = skip (transparent), 0.0+ = colorize
    if (value >= 0.0)
    {
        float4 outputColor = EvaluateGradient(value);
        OutputTexture[id.xy] = outputColor;
    }
}
```

**Performance:**
- **Before:** 105ms CPU processing
- **After:** ~1-2ms GPU dispatch
- **Improvement:** 50-100x faster

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ GPU-based processing (all visual work on GPU)
- ✅ Explicit GraphicsFormat (R8G8B8A8_UNorm prevents TYPELESS trap)
- ✅ enableRandomWrite set BEFORE RenderTexture creation
- ✅ Follows [explicit-graphics-format.md](../../decisions/explicit-graphics-format.md)

### 4. Converted ProvinceDevelopmentTexture to RenderTexture
**Files Changed:**
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/Rendering/CoreTextureSet.cs:21,32,142-182`
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/MapModes/MapModeDataTextures.cs:25`
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/MapTextureManager.cs:35`

**Before:**
```csharp
private Texture2D provinceDevelopmentTexture; // CPU-writeable only
texture.SetPixels32(pixels); // Slow CPU→GPU upload
```

**After:**
```csharp
private RenderTexture provinceDevelopmentTexture; // GPU-writeable (UAV)

var descriptor = new RenderTextureDescriptor(width, height,
    UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.R8G8B8A8_UNorm, 0);
descriptor.enableRandomWrite = true; // Required for compute shader UAV
var texture = new RenderTexture(descriptor);
```

**Why This Matters:**
- RenderTexture supports UAV (Unordered Access View) for compute shader writes
- Texture2D only supports CPU writes (SetPixels32)
- Explicit GraphicsFormat prevents TYPELESS format trap

### 5. Enabled Real-Time Map Mode Updates
**Files Changed:**
- `Assets/Game/MapModes/MapModeEventSubscriber.cs:48-64`
- `Assets/Game/MapModes/FarmMapMode.cs:112-115`

**Before:** Monthly updates (CPU too slow for real-time)
**After:** Event-driven updates with batching

**Pattern:**
1. Building completes → `BuildingCompletedEvent` fired
2. `MapModeEventSubscriber` receives event → marks FarmMapMode dirty, sets `needsUpdate = true`
3. `LateUpdate()` (end of frame) → calls `ForceTextureUpdate()` once
4. GPU compute shader dispatches (~1ms)
5. Multiple buildings in same frame → single batched update

### 6. Fixed Transparency Bug (Negative Values for Skip)
**Problem:** Provinces with minimum value normalized to `0.0` were being skipped

**Files Changed:**
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Shaders/GradientMapMode.compute:89-91`
- `Assets/Archon-Engine/Scripts/Map/MapModes/GradientMapMode.cs:268-272`

**Before:**
```hlsl
if (value > 0.0) // ❌ Skips valid 0.0 values (minimum in dataset)
```

**After:**
```hlsl
if (value >= 0.0) // ✅ Only negative values are skipped
```

**CPU Side:**
```csharp
// Intentionally skipped provinces (e.g., Farm mode "no farm")
if (value <= 0f)
{
    provinceValues[provinceId] = -1f; // Negative = skip (transparent)
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Farm mode:** Returns `0f` for "no farm" → marked as `-1f` → transparent ✅
- **Development mode:** Min value (e.g., dev=3) normalizes to `0.0` → colorized ✅
- **Distinction:** Negative values = intentionally skip, `0.0+` = valid data

### 7. Added Zoom-Based Fog of War Disabling
**Files Changed:**
- `Assets/Game/Camera/ParadoxStyleCameraController.cs:57-60,103-111,354-385`
- `Assets/Game/VisualStyles/EU3Classic/EU3MapShader.shader:67,170`
- `Assets/Game/Shaders/MapModes/MapModeCommon.hlsl:140-142`

**Implementation:**
- Camera sets `_FogOfWarZoomDisable` shader property based on current zoom
- Shader checks flag in `ApplyFogOfWar()` → early return if disabled
- Inspector-adjustable: `disableFogOfWarAboveZoom = 4.0` (default)

**User Feedback:**
> "Yes man! Works... Thanks man."

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: GPU-Only Gradient Colorization (No CPU Fallback)
**Context:** CPU implementation too slow (105ms), discovered during Farm mode testing

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep CPU implementation as fallback (safe but slow)
2. GPU-only with error handling (fast, no fallback)
3. Hybrid: GPU primary, CPU emergency fallback

**Decision:** GPU-only (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- GPU compute shaders universally supported on target platforms
- 50-100x performance improvement critical for real-time updates
- CPU fallback adds complexity with no real benefit
- If compute shader fails, graceful error (not crash)

**Trade-offs:**
- No fallback if GPU compute shader unavailable
- Acceptable: Target platforms all support compute shaders

### Decision 2: Use Negative Values for "Skip Province"
**Context:** Normalization makes minimum values → `0.0`, ambiguous with "skip"

**Options Considered:**
1. Use `0.0` to skip (simple but ambiguous)
2. Use negative values to skip (clear distinction)
3. Use separate mask texture (extra memory/complexity)

**Decision:** Negative values (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- Clear semantic distinction: `< 0` = skip, `>= 0` = valid data
- Zero memory overhead (reuse existing value buffer)
- Allows `0.0` as valid normalized minimum value
- Farm mode: `0f` raw → `-1f` buffer → transparent
- Development mode: min value → `0.0` normalized → colorized

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly less intuitive than `0.0 = skip`
- Acceptable: Well-documented in code comments

### Decision 3: Solid Green Gradient for Farm Mode
**Context:** User wanted green farms, but normalization made all farms → `0.5` → yellow

**Options Considered:**
1. Red→Yellow→Green gradient (original)
2. Green→Green→Green gradient (solid green)
3. Custom shader variant for binary modes

**Decision:** Green→Green→Green (Option 2)

**Rationale:**
- Simplest solution (no shader changes)
- All gradient positions = green → always green regardless of normalization
- Farm mode is binary (has/doesn't have), not spectrum
- User preference: green for farms, transparent for no farms

**User Feedback:**
> "farms should be green, not yellow" → Fixed with solid green gradient

## What Worked ✅

1. **GPU Compute Shader for Gradient Colorization**
   - What: Replace CPU pixel loop with GPU compute shader
   - Why it worked: 50-100x performance improvement (105ms → 1-2ms)
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - applies to ALL gradient map modes

2. **Negative Values for Skip Semantic**
   - What: Use `-1f` in GPU buffer to mark provinces to skip
   - Why it worked: Clear distinction from valid `0.0` normalized values
   - Impact: Fixed transparency bug, enables intentional transparency

3. **Event-Driven Updates with Batching**
   - What: `LateUpdate()` batches multiple events per frame into single GPU dispatch
   - Why it worked: Multiple buildings completing → 1 update (not N updates)
   - Reusable pattern: Yes - standard pattern for event-driven rendering updates

4. **Explicit GraphicsFormat for RenderTextures**
   - What: Always use `RenderTextureDescriptor` with explicit `GraphicsFormat`
   - Why it worked: Prevents TYPELESS format trap (from previous session learnings)
   - Impact: Deterministic GPU format, no platform-dependent surprises

---

## What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Real-Time Updates with CPU Pixel Processing**
   - What we tried: Event-driven updates with `SetPixels32()` CPU loop
   - Why it failed: 105ms per update = unplayable lag
   - Lesson learned: CPU pixel processing NEVER scales to millions of pixels
   - Don't try this again because: Violates core GPU-first architecture principle

2. **Using 0.1f as "No Farm" Value**
   - What we tried: Return `0.1f` for provinces without farms (small positive to avoid skip)
   - Why it failed: Normalization `(0.1 - 0.1) / range = 0.0` → transparent anyway
   - Lesson learned: Normalization makes minimum values → `0.0`, need explicit skip marker
   - Solution: Use `0f` raw value → marked as `-1f` in buffer → intentionally transparent

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: GradientMapMode Using CPU Pixel Processing
**Symptom:** 105ms per texture update, heavy lag when buildings complete

**Root Cause:**
```csharp
// CPU loop over 11.5M pixels
foreach (var pixel in provincePixels)
{
    pixels[index] = color;
}
texture.SetPixels32(pixels); // Huge CPU→GPU upload
```

**Investigation:**
- Tried: Batching multiple updates per frame (helped, but still 105ms)
- Tried: Monthly updates instead of real-time (workaround, not solution)
- Found: Architecture violation - should be GPU compute shader

**Solution:**
- Created `GradientMapMode.compute` shader
- Created `GradientComputeDispatcher.cs` to manage GPU dispatch
- Converted `ProvinceDevelopmentTexture` from Texture2D to RenderTexture (UAV-enabled)
- Refactored `GradientMapMode.cs` to use GPU dispatch instead of CPU loop

**Why This Works:**
- GPU processes all 11.5M pixels in parallel (~1ms)
- No CPU→GPU upload (compute shader writes directly to RenderTexture)
- Follows GPU-first architecture principle

**Pattern for Future:**
- ✅ **Always use GPU compute shaders for pixel-level processing**
- ✅ **RenderTexture + enableRandomWrite for compute shader output**
- ✅ **Explicit GraphicsFormat to prevent TYPELESS trap**

### Problem 2: Provinces with Minimum Value Showing as Transparent
**Symptom:** Development mode shows provinces with dev=3 as transparent (ocean color)

**Root Cause:**
- Normalization: `(value - minValue) / range`
- Min value (e.g., dev=3): `(3 - 3) / range = 0.0`
- Shader: `if (value > 0.0)` skips `0.0` → transparent

**Investigation:**
- Tried: Changing `0.1f` to avoid zero (failed due to normalization)
- Found: Need to distinguish "intentionally skip" vs "valid minimum value"

**Solution:**
- Use negative values to indicate "skip this province"
- Shader: `if (value >= 0.0)` → `0.0` is valid, only negative skipped
- CPU: Mark skip provinces as `-1f` in buffer

**Why This Works:**
- Semantic distinction: `< 0` = skip, `>= 0` = valid data
- Farm mode: `0f` raw → `-1f` buffer → transparent (intentional)
- Development mode: min value → `0.0` normalized → colorized (valid)

**Pattern for Future:**
- ✅ **Use negative values as sentinel/skip markers in GPU buffers**
- ✅ **Reserve 0.0 as valid data point (minimum in normalized range)**

### Problem 3: Compilation Errors After RenderTexture Conversion
**Symptom:** Multiple errors: `SetPixel()`, `Apply()`, type mismatches

**Root Cause:**
- RenderTexture doesn't support CPU pixel access (`SetPixel`, `SetPixels32`, `Apply`)
- Old code calling obsolete methods

**Investigation:**
- Found: `MapTextureManager.SetProvinceDevelopment()` delegating to removed method
- Found: `CoreTextureSet.SetProvinceDevelopment()` using `SetPixel()` on RenderTexture

**Solution:**
- Removed obsolete methods (CPU pixel access no longer needed)
- Added documentation comments explaining methods removed
- Updated all property types from `Texture2D` to `RenderTexture`

**Why This Works:**
- ProvinceDevelopmentTexture now GPU-managed (compute shader writes directly)
- No CPU pixel access needed (all updates via GPU)

---

## Architecture Impact

### Documentation Updates Required
- [x] None - already compliant with documented GPU-first principle
- [x] GradientMapMode now follows architecture (was violation)

### New Patterns Discovered
**Pattern:** Negative Values as Skip Markers in GPU Buffers
- When to use: Need to mark "skip this element" in normalized data
- Benefits: Clear semantic, zero memory overhead, allows `0.0` as valid data
- Example: `< 0` = skip, `>= 0` = process

**Pattern:** Event-Driven GPU Updates with Batching
- When to use: Real-time updates from gameplay events
- Benefits: Multiple events → single GPU dispatch per frame
- Example: BuildingCompletedEvent → mark dirty → LateUpdate batched update

### Anti-Pattern Fixed
**Anti-Pattern:** CPU Pixel Processing for Map Modes
- What not to do: Loop over millions of pixels on CPU
- Why it's bad: 105ms vs 1ms (50-100x slower)
- Impact: Real-time updates impossible, violates GPU-first architecture

### Architectural Decisions That Changed
- **Changed:** Gradient map mode colorization
- **From:** CPU pixel loop with SetPixels32
- **To:** GPU compute shader with RenderTexture UAV
- **Scope:** All gradient-based map modes (Development, Economy, Farm, etc.)
- **Reason:** Performance (105ms → 1ms), architecture compliance (GPU-first)

## Code Quality Notes

### Performance
- **Measured:**
  - Before: 105ms per gradient update (3453 provinces, 11.5M pixels)
  - After: 1-2ms per gradient update
- **Target:** <5ms per map mode update (from architecture docs)
- **Status:** ✅ Exceeds target (1-2ms well under 5ms)

### Testing

  - ✅ Development map mode shows full gradient (no transparency)
  - ✅ Real-time updates when building farms (no lag)
  - ✅ Fog of war disables at high zoom (4.0+)
  - ✅ Multiple buildings completing → single update per frame

### Technical Debt
- **Paid Down:**
  - Removed CPU pixel processing anti-pattern
  - Removed obsolete methods (SetProvinceDevelopment)
- **Created:** None
- **TODOs:** None

## Notes & Observations

**User's Discovery:**
> "Wait, are we not already using GPU Compute Shader? Thats A HUGE MISS and not in our architecture plans"

This was a critical catch by the user - GradientMapMode was violating the GPU-first architecture principle documented in CLAUDE.md. The CPU implementation worked for prototyping but completely failed at scale (105ms = unplayable).

**Visual Discovery:**
User discovered an interesting visual effect during testing:
> "Very odd bug though... At the start of the game everything is yellow, expected because no farms. Then I build a farm, my province with farm turns green. Everything else turns transparent. I just see the borders. Its actually a really cool effect! I prefer that over the yellow."

This "bug" became a feature - transparent provinces for "no farm" looks cleaner than colored provinces. Led to the negative-value-as-skip-marker pattern.

**Performance Impact:**
The GPU refactor is transformative:
- **Before:** Real-time updates impossible (105ms lag)
- **After:** Real-time updates smooth (1-2ms, imperceptible)
- **Future:** Enables more complex map modes without performance concerns

**Architecture Validation:**
This session validated the importance of the GPU-first principle. The architecture was RIGHT, but the implementation was WRONG. User caught it immediately, and fixing it unlocked real-time capabilities that were previously impossible.

*Session completed 2025-10-25 - GPU architecture compliance restored, real-time map modes enabled*
