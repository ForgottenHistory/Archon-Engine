# Decision: UI Presenter Pattern for Complex Panels
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** âœ… Implemented
**Impact:** Breaking change (file structure refactor)
**Maintainability:** 1,047â†’553 lines (47% reduction in view), 4 focused files

---

## Decision Summary

**Changed:** Monolithic UI panels split into View + Presenter + ActionHandler + EventSubscriber
**Reason:** Maintain <500 line guideline, enable testability, separate UI concerns
**Trade-off:** More files (4 vs 1) for better maintainability and scalability

---

## Context

**Problem:** ProvinceInfoPanel (1,047 lines) exceeded guideline, mixed UI creation with business logic
**Constraint:** Grand strategy games have massive amounts of UI - must scale
**Goal:** All UI files <560 lines, clear separation of concerns, reusable pattern for all panels

**Previous Architecture (Monolithic):**
```
ProvinceInfoPanel.cs (1,047 lines)
  - UI creation (150 lines)
  - Data formatting (200 lines)
  - User actions (300 lines)
  - Event handling (150 lines)
  - All mixed in one file
```

**Issue:** Single file too large, unclear responsibilities, hard to test

---

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Keep Monolithic, Accept Violation
**Approach:** Accept 1,000+ line UI files, no changes
**Pros:** No refactor needed, simpler file structure
**Cons:** Will grow unbounded as features added, violates guideline
**Rejected:** User: "Grand strategy games have a ton of UI, that's the whole game basically"

### Option 2: Extract Only Actions
**Approach:** Move button click handlers to separate file
**Pros:** Partial improvement, minimal changes
**Cons:** Still 700+ lines, doesn't solve scalability
**Rejected:** Doesn't address root problem

### Option 3: UI Presenter Pattern - View/Presenter/Handler/Subscriber (CHOSEN)
**Approach:** Separate View (UI creation) from Presenter (data formatting) from Handler (actions) from Subscriber (events)
**Pros:** Clear separation, testable components, scales to any panel complexity
**Cons:** More files (4 vs 1)
**Chosen:** Matches MVP pattern, establishes standard for all future UI

---

## Final Decision

**Architecture:** View delegates to Presenter for display, Handler for actions, Subscriber for events

### ProvinceInfoPanel Structure:
```
ProvinceInfoPanel.cs (553 lines) - PURE VIEW
  - UI creation (UI Toolkit programmatic)
  - Show/hide panel
  - Route button clicks to action handler
  - Delegate display updates to presenter
  - Minimal logic (only coordination)

ProvinceInfoPresenter.cs (304 lines) - PRESENTATION LOGIC (STATELESS)
  - Static methods receiving dependencies as parameters
  - UpdatePanelData() - format province/owner/development
  - UpdateBuildingInfo() - show buildings/construction/buttons
  - UpdateUnitsInfo() - unit counter display
  - UpdateRecruitButton() - button visibility logic
  - UpdateSelectUnitsButton() - movement mode button states

ProvinceActionHandler.cs (296 lines) - USER ACTIONS (STATELESS)
  - Static methods for all user actions
  - TryBuildBuilding() - validate and build
  - TryRecruitInfantry() - validate and recruit
  - ToggleMovementMode() - unit selection state machine
  - MoveUnitsToProvince() - execute unit movement

ProvinceEventSubscriber.cs (116 lines) - EVENT MANAGEMENT
  - Manages all event subscriptions
  - Subscribe() / Unsubscribe() lifecycle
  - Routes events to callbacks (panel owns callbacks)
  - Clean separation of event sources from view
```

---

## Rationale

**Why Presenter Pattern for UI:**
- UI has different concerns than systems (display vs logic)
- View should only coordinate, not contain business logic
- Presenter handles "how to format data for display"
- Handler handles "what to do when user clicks"
- Subscriber handles "what events to listen to"

**Why Stateless Presenter/Handler:**
- No hidden state (all dependencies explicit via parameters)
- Pure functions (testable without UI initialization)
- Easy to unit test (pass mock data, verify output)
- Clear contracts (parameters show dependencies)

**Why View Owns State:**
- View is MonoBehaviour (Unity lifecycle)
- View owns UI elements (labels, buttons)
- View routes to presenters/handlers (thin coordination layer)
- View manages event subscriber (owns callbacks)

**Why Separate EventSubscriber:**
- Event subscriptions scattered across panel methods
- Lifecycle management (subscribe in Initialize, unsubscribe in OnDestroy)
- Single place to see all event dependencies
- Easier to debug event-related issues

---

## Trade-offs Accepted

**File Count:**
- OLD: 1 file (1,047 lines)
- NEW: 4 files (553 + 304 + 296 + 116 lines)
- **Acceptable:** Each file focused on single concern

**Parameter Passing:**
- Presenter/Handler methods require many parameters
- Example: `UpdateBuildingInfo(provinceID, owner, playerCountryID, buildingSystem, buildingRegistry, economySystem, buildingsLabel, constructionLabel, buildFarmButton)`
- **Acceptable:** Explicit dependencies better than hidden coupling

**Delegation Overhead:**
- View calls Presenter â†’ Presenter formats data â†’ View displays
- View calls Handler â†’ Handler validates â†’ Handler executes command
- **Acceptable:** Negligible performance cost, huge maintainability gain

---

## Implementation Impact

**ProvinceInfoPanel:**
- **Files Modified:** 1 (ProvinceInfoPanel.cs - 1,047â†’553 lines)
- **Files Created:** 3 (Presenter, Handler, Subscriber)
- **Breaking Changes:** None (public API unchanged)
- **Migration:** None needed (internal refactor only)

**Testing:**
- User confirmed: "yeah it works. nice man."
- All UI functionality preserved
- Build/recruit/movement all working

## Pattern: When to Use UI Presenter

**Use UI Presenter When:**

1. **Panel Exceeds 500 Lines**
   - UI file has grown too large
   - Multiple concerns mixed (display + actions + events)
   - Hard to navigate/understand

2. **Multiple User Actions**
   - Panel has 3+ button handlers
   - Actions have complex validation/execution
   - Actions could be tested independently

3. **Complex Display Logic**
   - Data formatting requires queries and calculations
   - Button visibility depends on multiple conditions
   - Display updates triggered by multiple events

4. **Interactive Panel (Not Static Display)**
   - User can perform actions (build, recruit, etc.)
   - Panel updates in response to events
   - Use simpler pattern for read-only displays

**Don't Use UI Presenter When:**

1. **Simple Display Panel (<200 Lines)**
   - Static information only
   - No user actions
   - No need to over-engineer

2. **Single Action Panel**
   - Only one button
   - Minimal logic
   - Keep simple, don't split

3. **Temporary/Debug UI**
   - Debug panels
   - Prototypes
   - Not worth the overhead

---

## Pattern: UI Presenter Components

**View (MonoBehaviour):**
- UI Toolkit creation (programmatic)
- Show/hide panel
- Route clicks to handler
- Delegate display to presenter
- Manage subscriber lifecycle
- Minimal logic (coordination only)

**Presenter (Static Class):**
- Data queries from game state
- Format data for display
- Determine button visibility/state
- Update UI element text/colors
- All methods static (stateless)

**ActionHandler (Static Class):**
- Validate user actions
- Execute commands
- Return success/failure
- All methods static (stateless)

**EventSubscriber (Class Instance):**
- Subscribe to all events
- Unsubscribe on destroy
- Route events to callbacks
- Owned by view

---

## Consistency Across Codebase

**Panels Using UI Presenter Pattern:**
- âœ… ProvinceInfoPanel - Session 3 refactor (first implementation)
- ðŸ”„ CountryInfoPanel - Next candidate (similar complexity)

**Future Applications:**
- DiplomacyPanel (when implemented)
- TradePanel (when implemented)
- MilitaryPanel (when implemented)
- Any panel >500 lines or with complex actions

**Goal:** All interactive UI panels use UI Presenter pattern

---

## Lessons Learned

**UI is Different from Systems:**
- Systems use Facade pattern (runtime state management)
- UI uses Presenter pattern (stateless display/action logic)
- Different concerns require different patterns

**Stateless is Testable:**
- Presenter methods trivial to test (pass data, verify output)
- Handler methods can be tested without UI (mock dependencies)
- View can be tested separately (just UI creation)

**Event Management is Complex:**
- Centralizing subscriptions in EventSubscriber improves clarity
- Easy to see all event dependencies in one place
- Lifecycle management (subscribe/unsubscribe) safer

**Grand Strategy UI Scales:**
- Pattern designed for "tons of UI" (user's words)
- Adding new action = add method to Handler
- Adding new display = add method to Presenter
- View remains stable (~200 lines for UI creation)

---

## Documentation Impact

- `Assets/Game/FILE_REGISTRY.md` - New UI pattern structure documented

**Created:**
- `decisions/ui-presenter-pattern-for-panels.md` - This doc

**To Update:**

## Quick Reference

**UI Presenter Pattern Template:**

```csharp
// 1. View (MonoBehaviour) - UI creation and coordination
public class PanelView : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Label dataLabel;
    private Button actionButton;
    private EventSubscriber eventSubscriber;

    private void InitializeUI()
    {
        // Create UI elements (UI Toolkit)
        dataLabel = CreateLabel("data");
        actionButton = CreateButton("action", OnActionClicked);
    }

    public void Initialize(Dependencies deps)
    {
        // Subscribe to events via subscriber
        eventSubscriber = new EventSubscriber(deps);
        eventSubscriber.OnDataChanged = OnDataChanged;
        eventSubscriber.Subscribe();
    }

    private void UpdateDisplay(Data data)
    {
        // DELEGATE: Format and display data
        PanelPresenter.UpdateData(data, dataLabel);
    }

    private void OnActionClicked()
    {
        // DELEGATE: Execute action
        if (PanelActionHandler.TryPerformAction(data, deps))
        {
            UpdateDisplay(newData);
        }
    }
}

// 2. Presenter (Static) - Data formatting
public static class PanelPresenter
{
    public static void UpdateData(Data data, Label label)
    {
        // Query game state
        // Format data
        // Update UI element
        label.text = $"Value: {data.value}";
    }
}

// 3. ActionHandler (Static) - User actions
public static class PanelActionHandler
{
    public static bool TryPerformAction(Data data, Dependencies deps)
    {
        // Validate
        if (!IsValid(data)) return false;

        // Execute command
        ExecuteCommand(data, deps);
        return true;
    }
}

// 4. EventSubscriber - Event management
public class EventSubscriber
{
    public Action<Data> OnDataChanged { get; set; }

    public void Subscribe()
    {
        eventSource.OnChanged += OnDataChanged;
    }

    public void Unsubscribe()
    {
        eventSource.OnChanged -= OnDataChanged;
    }
}
```

**Adding New Action:**
```csharp
// 1. Add method to Handler
public static bool TryNewAction(params) { ... }

// 2. Add button in View.InitializeUI()
newButton = CreateButton("new", OnNewClicked);

// 3. Add click handler in View
private void OnNewClicked()
{
    if (PanelActionHandler.TryNewAction(...))
        UpdateDisplay(...);
}

// Done! View remains ~200 lines, handler grows linearly
```
