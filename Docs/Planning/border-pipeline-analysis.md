## Major Confusion Points

### 1. Three Border Textures with Unclear Purposes

**BorderTexture** (Full resolution, RGBA8):
- Created by: DynamicTextureSet
- Populated by: BorderDistanceFieldGenerator.GenerateDistanceField()
- Format: R8G8B8A8_UNorm
- Current usage: Distance field mode (R/G channels for country/province distances)
- **CONFUSION**: Name doesn't indicate it's a distance field texture

**BorderMaskTexture** (Full resolution, RGBA8):
- Created by: DynamicTextureSet
- Populated by: BorderComputeDispatcher.GenerateBorderMask() → DetectDualBorders kernel
- Format: R8G8B8A8_UNorm (but only R/G channels used)
- Current usage: Pixel-perfect mode (R=country borders, G=province borders)
- **CONFUSION**: Name sounds like a simple mask, but it's actually dual-channel border data

**BorderDistanceTexture** (1/2 resolution, RG8):
- Created by: DynamicTextureSet
- Populated by: ??? (seems unused now?)
- Format: R8G8_UNorm
- Current usage: UNKNOWN
- **CONFUSION**: Is this obsolete? Was it replaced by BorderTexture?

### 2. Method Names Don't Match What They Do

**GenerateBorderMask()** (BorderComputeDispatcher.cs:380):
```csharp
public void GenerateBorderMask()
{
    // Uses DetectDualBorders kernel, NOT GenerateBorderMask kernel!
    borderDetectionCompute.Dispatch(detectDualBordersKernel, ...);
}
```
- **CONFUSION**: Method named "GenerateBorderMask" but calls "detectDualBordersKernel"
- **CONFUSION**: There's ALSO a "generateBorderMaskKernel" that's NOT used by this method

**DetectBorders()** (BorderComputeDispatcher.cs:473):
```csharp
public void DetectBorders()
{
    // Only used in distance field mode
    // Generates distance field, not "detecting" anything
    if (renderingMode == BorderRenderingMode.ShaderDistanceField)
    {
        distanceFieldGenerator.GenerateDistanceField();
    }
}
```
- **CONFUSION**: Name suggests border detection, but actually generates distance fields
- **CONFUSION**: Has early returns for pixel-perfect/mesh modes - method does nothing in those modes

**InitializeSmoothBorders()** (BorderComputeDispatcher.cs:226):
- Extracts border polylines from province pixels
- Smooths them with RDP + Chaikin
- Generates distance field OR mesh depending on mode
- **CONFUSION**: Name says "smooth borders" but it does WAY more than that - it's the entire initialization pipeline

### 3. Six Compute Shader Kernels with Overlapping Purposes

**In BorderDetection.compute**:
1. `DetectBorders` - Simple border detection (any neighbor different) → writes to BorderTexture
2. `DetectBordersThick` - Thick border detection → writes to BorderTexture
3. `DetectCountryBorders` - Country borders only → writes to BorderTexture
4. `DetectDualBorders` - **ACTUALLY USED** for pixel-perfect mode → writes R=country, G=province
5. `GenerateBorderMask` - **NOT USED ANYMORE** (was for single-channel mask)
6. `CopyBorderToMask` - Copies BorderTexture to BorderMask → usage unclear

**CONFUSION**:
- Which kernels are actually used?
- Which are obsolete?
- Why have 6 kernels when we only use 2-3?

### 4. Two "BorderMode" Enums

**BorderMode** (lines 22-27 in BorderComputeDispatcher):
```csharp
public enum BorderMode
{
    None,
    Province,
    Country,
    Dual
}
```
- Controls which borders to show (country, province, both)
- Seems to be shader parameters, not actual rendering modes

**BorderRenderingMode** (lines 64-80):
```csharp
public enum BorderRenderingMode
{
    None,
    ShaderDistanceField,
    MeshGeometry,
    ShaderPixelPerfect
}
```
- Controls HOW borders are rendered

**CONFUSION**: These are separate concepts but both are called "border mode"

### 5. Data Flow Is Unclear

**For ShaderPixelPerfect mode**:
```
User sets mode → SetBorderRenderingMode()
                ↓
         InitializeSmoothBorders()
                ↓
         (extracts polylines, smooths them)
                ↓
         GenerateBorderMask()  ← MISLEADING NAME
                ↓
         DetectDualBorders kernel  ← Actually what's called
                ↓
         BorderMaskTexture (R/G channels)
                ↓
         Shader samples BorderMask.rg
```

**For ShaderDistanceField mode**:
```
User sets mode → SetBorderRenderingMode()
                ↓
         InitializeSmoothBorders()
                ↓
         (extracts polylines, smooths them)
                ↓
         GenerateDistanceField()
                ↓
         JFA algorithm
                ↓
         BorderTexture (R/G channels)
                ↓
         Shader samples BorderTexture.rg
```

**CONFUSION**: Both modes populate different textures (BorderMask vs BorderTexture) but go through similar initialization

## Session-Specific Confusion Examples

### Example 1: "Where are the borders rendering from?"
- Spent time debugging why borders weren't rendering
- Turned out shader code was commented out
- Didn't know which texture the shader was sampling from
- Didn't know BorderTexture vs BorderMask difference

### Example 2: "Why are there gray borders on country borders?"
- Both sides of border were rendering
- Didn't understand that BorderMask marks ALL border pixels
- Had to experiment with sampling owner texture
- Eventually realized we should use dual-channel approach

### Example 3: "What does GenerateBorderMask() actually do?"
- Method name says "generate mask"
- But it actually dispatches DetectDualBorders kernel
- And there's ALSO a GenerateBorderMask kernel that's NOT used
- Very confusing!

### Example 4: "Is BorderDistanceTexture used?"
- Found three border textures
- Couldn't determine which were active
- BorderDistanceTexture seems unused but still created

### Example 5: "How do I switch between modes?"
- Call SetBorderRenderingMode()?
- Or call InitializeSmoothBorders()?
- Or call GenerateBorderMask()?
- Not clear what the entry point is

## Root Causes of Confusion

### 1. Names Don't Match Reality
- GenerateBorderMask() doesn't use GenerateBorderMask kernel
- DetectBorders() generates distance fields, doesn't "detect"
- BorderTexture is actually a distance field texture
- BorderMaskTexture is actually dual-channel border data

### 2. Too Many Unused/Obsolete Things
- 6 compute kernels, but only 2-3 actually used
- BorderDistanceTexture seems unused
- Legacy compute shaders (BorderSDF, BorderCurveRasterizer)
- Method names reference old approaches

### 3. No Clear Entry Points
- Multiple ways to initialize: InitializeSmoothBorders(), GenerateBorderMask(), DetectBorders()
- Not clear which to call when
- Methods have side effects and dependencies not obvious from names

### 4. Mixed Abstractions
- BorderMode (what to show) mixed with BorderRenderingMode (how to render)
- Compute shader selection hidden inside methods
- Texture creation separated from population

---

## Proposed Cleanup (Summary)

### Phase 1: Rename for Clarity
1. `BorderTexture` → `DistanceFieldTexture`
2. `BorderMaskTexture` → `PixelBorderTexture` or `DualBorderTexture`
3. `GenerateBorderMask()` → `GeneratePixelPerfectBorders()`
4. `DetectBorders()` → `RenderBorders()` or `UpdateBorders()`
5. `InitializeSmoothBorders()` → `InitializeBorderPipeline()`

### Phase 2: Delete Obsolete
1. Remove unused compute kernels (GenerateBorderMask, CopyBorderToMask if unused)
2. Delete BorderDistanceTexture if truly unused
3. Remove obsolete shaders (BorderSDF.compute, BorderCurveRasterizer.compute if unused)

### Phase 3: Simplify API
1. Single entry point: `Initialize()` that handles all modes
2. Single update point: `UpdateBorders()` that handles runtime changes
3. Clear documentation of which textures are used in which mode

### Phase 4: Separate Concerns
1. BorderMode (what) separate from BorderRenderingMode (how)
2. Texture creation separate from population (already is, but make clearer)
3. Compute kernel selection explicit, not hidden
