# Core Pillars Implementation Plan
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Type:** ENGINE Feature Implementation
**Scope:** Complete the four pillars of grand strategy
**Status:** üìã Planning

---

## OVERVIEW

Grand strategy games have **four core pillars:**
1. ‚úÖ **Economy** - Resource management, production, trade
2. üîÑ **Military** - Units, movement, combat (units + movement ‚úÖ, combat pending)
3. ‚úÖ **Diplomacy** - Relations, treaties, alliances, UI
4. ‚úÖ **AI** - Decision-making, opponents, challenge (Phase 1 MVP)

**Current Status:** Economy pillar ‚úÖ complete. Military pillar üîÑ in progress (units, movement, pathfinding ‚úÖ complete; combat ‚è≥ pending). Diplomacy pillar ‚úÖ complete (relations + treaties + UI). AI pillar ‚úÖ Phase 1 MVP complete (goal-oriented decision making).

**Goal:** Validate Archon-Engine architecture with all four pillars working together.

---

## PILLAR 1: ECONOMY ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**What Works:**
- Multi-resource system (gold, manpower)
- Building construction with costs and effects
- Income calculation with modifier stacking
- Tax collection and treasury management
- Resource events (OnResourceChanged)

**Validated Architecture:**
- ResourceSystem (generic storage)
- ModifierSystem (bonuses/penalties)
- Command pattern (all state changes)
- Save/Load (full serialization)

---

## PILLAR 2: MILITARY (In Progress)

### 2.1 Unit System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ UnitSystem - Manages all units (NativeArray<UnitState>)
- ‚úÖ UnitState - 8-byte struct (provinceID, countryID, type, strength, morale)
- ‚úÖ UnitRegistry - Unit type definitions (infantry, cavalry, artillery)
- ‚úÖ UnitCommands - CreateUnit, MoveUnit, DisbandUnit
- ‚úÖ UnitVisualizationSystem - 3D cube visuals with count badges
- ‚úÖ Save/Load support with round-trip validation

**Data Structure:**
```csharp
// 8 bytes - fits in cache line
struct UnitState {
    ushort provinceID;     // Current location
    ushort countryID;      // Owner
    ushort unitTypeID;     // Infantry/Cavalry/etc
    byte strength;         // 0-100 (percentage)
    byte morale;           // 0-100
}
```

**Status:** Core unit system complete. Units can be created, disbanded, moved, and saved/loaded. 3D visualization working with aggregate display per province.

**See:** [unit-system-implementation.md](unit-system-implementation.md) for detailed documentation.

### 2.2 Movement System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ PathfindingSystem - A* pathfinding for multi-province paths
- ‚úÖ UnitMovementQueue - Time-based movement with daily tick progression
- ‚úÖ Multi-hop movement - Automatic waypoint progression
- ‚úÖ MoveUnitCommand - Pathfinding integration
- ‚úÖ Save/Load mid-journey support

**Movement Features:**

- A* pathfinding allows moving to any province in one click
- Automatic waypoint hopping through intermediate provinces
- Movement queue tracks in-transit units with progress tracking
- Visual progress bars show movement status on map

**Pathfinding:**
- A* algorithm with h=0 (Dijkstra mode) for MVP
- MVP uses uniform costs (all provinces = 1)
- Future-ready for terrain movement costs
- Future-ready for movement blocking (ZOC, borders, military access)

**Status:** Movement system complete with pathfinding. Units can move across entire map in one click with automatic multi-hop progression.

**See:** [unit-system-implementation.md](unit-system-implementation.md) - Phases 2A, 2B, 2C for detailed documentation.

### 2.3 Combat System

**ENGINE Components:**
- CombatSystem - Resolves battles each tick
- BattleResolver - Deterministic damage calculation
- CombatModifierTypes - Attack, Defense, Discipline, Morale

**Combat Resolution:**
- When opposing units in same province ‚Üí battle
- Damage formula: (attacker strength √ó attack mods) vs (defender strength √ó defense mods)
- Morale damage ‚Üí units retreat when morale breaks
- Casualties calculated with FixedPoint64 (deterministic)

**Modifiers Apply:**
- Terrain bonuses (defender in mountains +25% defense)
- Building bonuses (fort gives +50% defense)
- Tech bonuses (military tech gives +10% discipline)
- General traits (if we add them later)

**Validation:**
- 100 simultaneous battles, verify <10ms resolution
- Save/Load mid-battle, verify outcome unchanged

- ‚úÖ Save/Load support with full modifier persistence

**Data Structure:**
```csharp
// Flat storage for Burst compatibility
NativeList<ModifierWithKey> allModifiers;  // All modifiers tagged with relationshipKey
NativeParallelHashMap<ulong, int> modifierCache;  // O(1) lookup by relationship

struct RelationState {
    FixedPoint64 baseOpinion;
    // Modifiers stored separately in flat array
}

struct OpinionModifier {
    ushort modifierTypeID;
    int startTick;
    FixedPoint64 decayRate;
    FixedPoint64 magnitude;
}
```

**Opinion System Features:**
- Base relations (configurable per country pair)
- Timed modifiers (wars, alliances, insults, rivalries)
- Automatic decay over time (linear decay to zero)
- Clamped total opinion (-200 to +200)
- Burst-compiled parallel decay processing

**Performance:**
- 610,750 modifiers (extreme stress test) processed in 3ms
- 87% improvement from Burst optimization
- O(1) cache lookup for GetOpinion queries
- Deterministic fixed-point math for multiplayer

**Status:** Relations system complete with production-ready performance. Can handle 61k relationships with 10 modifiers each.

- Military Access (troop movement rights, +20 opinion)
- Non-Aggression Pact (cannot declare war, +10 opinion)

**Treaty Storage:**
```csharp
struct TreatyState {
    ushort country1;
    ushort country2;
    ushort treatyTypeID;
    int startTick;
    int expirationTick; // 0 = permanent
}
```

**Treaty System Features:**
- Opinion-based acceptance (requires minimum opinion threshold)
- Opinion modifiers on treaty creation/breaking
- Expiration handling (timed vs permanent treaties)
- Policy-driven definitions (GAME layer)
- Sparse storage (only active treaties stored)

**Performance:**
- Stress tested with 36,912 simultaneous treaty proposals (all possible pairs)
- Sub-millisecond treaty evaluation
- Scales to 350 countries (maximum capacity test)

**Status:** Treaty system complete with full lifecycle (propose, accept, expire, break). Ready for AI integration.

**See:** [diplomacy-system-implementation.md](diplomacy-system-implementation.md) Phase 2 for detailed documentation.

### 3.3 Diplomacy UI ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-10-25)

**Implemented Components:**

- ‚úÖ CountryUIBuilder - UI element creation with explicit styling (217 lines)

**Features:**
- Opinion display with descriptive labels (Excellent/Good/Neutral/Poor/Bad/Hostile)
- War status (at war with X countries / at peace)
- Alliance status (allied with X countries)
- Treaty status (treaty count)
- Declare war button (validates treaty requirements)
- Propose alliance button (requires +50 opinion)
- Improve relations button (costs 50 gold, +5 opinion)
- Real-time updates via EventBus (war, peace, alliance, opinion changes)

**Architecture:**
- **Pattern:** UI Presenter Pattern with 5 components (View + Presenter + ActionHandler + EventSubscriber + UIBuilder)
- **Why 5 components:** UI creation exceeded 150 lines (proactive scalability)
- **Event Integration:** EventBus pattern for system events (NOT C# events)
- **Scalability:** View stays ~500 lines, ready for future diplomacy features

**Key Technical Details:**
- EventBus: `gameState.EventBus.Subscribe<EventType>(handler)` (zero-allocation)
- Commands: Property initialization pattern `new Command { Prop = val }`
- GetOpinion: Requires `currentTick` for deterministic temporal queries
- UpdateCountryID: EventSubscriber filters events for displayed country

**Status:** Diplomacy UI complete. Player can view diplomatic status and perform diplomacy actions (declare war, form alliances, improve relations).

**See:** [diplomacy-system-implementation.md](diplomacy-system-implementation.md) Phase 3 and Session Log `4-ui-presenter-pattern-diplomacy-ui.md` for detailed documentation.

## PILLAR 4: AI ‚úÖ PHASE 1 MVP COMPLETE (2025-10-25)

### 4.1 AI Framework ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ AISystem - Manages AI for 979 countries with bucketing scheduler
- ‚úÖ AIState - 8-byte struct (countryID, bucket, flags, activeGoalID)
- ‚úÖ AIGoal - Base class with Evaluate/Execute pattern
- ‚úÖ AIScheduler - Picks best goal and executes it
- ‚úÖ AIGoalRegistry - Plug-and-play goal system
- ‚úÖ AITickHandler - Two-phase initialization (system startup, player selection)

**AI Architecture:**
- **Goal-Oriented Decision Making** pattern
- Bucketing strategy: 979 countries / 30 days = ~33 AI per day
- Goals scored with FixedPoint64 (deterministic)
- Best goal executed via Command Pattern (same as player)
- Zero allocations (NativeArray with Allocator.Persistent)

**Storage Pattern:**
```csharp
struct AIState {
    ushort countryID;      // 2 bytes
    byte bucket;           // 1 byte (0-29)
    byte flags;            // 1 byte (IsActive bit)
    ushort activeGoalID;   // 2 bytes
    ushort reserved;       // 2 bytes
    // Total: 8 bytes
}
```

**Two-Phase Initialization:**
1. **System Startup**: Register AISystem, register goals (GameSystemInitializer)
2. **Player Selection**: Initialize AI states, disable player AI (CountrySelectionUI)

**Performance:**
- Bucketing: ~33 countries per day across 30 buckets
- Goal evaluation: 2 goals per country (BuildEconomy, ExpandTerritory)
- Command execution: Uses player's command system (DeclareWarCommand, BuildBuildingCommand)

**Logging:**
- `core_ai.log` - ENGINE layer (AISystem, bucketing, scheduling)
- `game_ai.log` - GAME layer (BuildEconomyGoal, ExpandTerritoryGoal)

**Status:** AI framework complete with 979 AI countries making decisions. Bucketing working perfectly, wars being declared based on strength ratios.

**See:** [ai-system-implementation.md](ai-system-implementation.md) for detailed documentation.

### 4.2 AI Goals (Phase 1 MVP) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Goals:**
- ‚úÖ BuildEconomyGoal - Farm construction when income < 50 gold/month
- ‚úÖ ExpandTerritoryGoal - War declaration against weak neighbors (strength ratio > 1.5x)

**BuildEconomyGoal Logic:**
```csharp
Evaluate():
  - Income < 50 gold/month ‚Üí Score 500 (critical)
  - Income < 100 gold/month ‚Üí Score 200 (medium)
  - Income >= 100 gold/month ‚Üí Score 50 (low)

Execute():
  - Find province without farm and not constructing
  - Submit BuildBuildingCommand("farm")
  - Uses player's command validation (can't cheat)
```

**ExpandTerritoryGoal Logic:**
```csharp
Evaluate():
  - Get neighbor countries (via adjacency)
  - Calculate strength ratio (my provinces / their provinces √ó 100)
  - If ratio >= 150% ‚Üí Score 150 (high priority)
  - Otherwise ‚Üí Score 10 (low priority)

Execute():
  - Find weakest valid neighbor (most provinces < threshold)
  - Skip if allied or at war already
  - Submit DeclareWarCommand
  - Uses player's diplomacy system (same validation)
```

**Observed Behavior:**
- Wars declared with strength ratios from 150% to 3200%
- Smart filtering (no wars against allies, already at war, etc.)
- BuildEconomy not yet active (scenario needs low income + high treasury)

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ 979 AI countries making decisions
- ‚úÖ Goal scoring working (500, 200, 150, 50, 10 observed)
- ‚úÖ Command Pattern integration (uses player commands)
- ‚úÖ Deterministic (FixedPoint64 scores)

### 4.3 AI Personality (Phase 2+)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- AIPersonality modifiers
- Personality traits (Aggressive, Defensive, Economic, Diplomatic)
- Goal score adjustments based on personality

**Extensibility Ready:**
```csharp
// Goals already have ApplyPersonality hook (optional override)
public virtual FixedPoint64 ApplyPersonality(FixedPoint64 score, AIPersonality personality) {
    return score;  // MVP: no adjustment
}
```

**Future Implementation:**
- Phase 2: Add personality system
- Phase 3: Balance personality modifiers
- Phase 4: AI difficulty levels
