# Core Pillars Implementation Plan
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Type:** ENGINE Feature Implementation
**Scope:** Complete the four pillars of grand strategy
**Status:** üìã Planning

---

## OVERVIEW

Grand strategy games have **four core pillars:**
1. ‚úÖ **Economy** - Resource management, production, trade
2. üîÑ **Military** - Units, movement, combat (units + movement ‚úÖ, combat pending)
3. ‚ùå **Diplomacy** - Relations, treaties, alliances
4. ‚ùå **AI** - Decision-making, opponents, challenge

**Current Status:** Economy pillar complete. Military pillar in progress (units, movement, pathfinding complete; combat pending). Need to implement Diplomacy, AI.

**Goal:** Validate Archon-Engine architecture with all four pillars working together.

---

## PILLAR 1: ECONOMY ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**What Works:**
- Multi-resource system (gold, manpower)
- Building construction with costs and effects
- Income calculation with modifier stacking
- Tax collection and treasury management
- Resource events (OnResourceChanged)

**Validated Architecture:**
- ResourceSystem (generic storage)
- ModifierSystem (bonuses/penalties)
- Command pattern (all state changes)
- Save/Load (full serialization)

---

## PILLAR 2: MILITARY (In Progress)

### 2.1 Unit System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ UnitSystem - Manages all units (NativeArray<UnitState>)
- ‚úÖ UnitState - 8-byte struct (provinceID, countryID, type, strength, morale)
- ‚úÖ UnitRegistry - Unit type definitions (infantry, cavalry, artillery)
- ‚úÖ UnitCommands - CreateUnit, MoveUnit, DisbandUnit
- ‚úÖ UnitVisualizationSystem - 3D cube visuals with count badges
- ‚úÖ Save/Load support with round-trip validation

**Data Structure:**
```csharp
// 8 bytes - fits in cache line
struct UnitState {
    ushort provinceID;     // Current location
    ushort countryID;      // Owner
    ushort unitTypeID;     // Infantry/Cavalry/etc
    byte strength;         // 0-100 (percentage)
    byte morale;           // 0-100
}
```

**Status:** Core unit system complete. Units can be created, disbanded, moved, and saved/loaded. 3D visualization working with aggregate display per province.

**See:** [unit-system-implementation.md](unit-system-implementation.md) for detailed documentation.

### 2.2 Movement System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ PathfindingSystem - A* pathfinding for multi-province paths
- ‚úÖ UnitMovementQueue - Time-based movement with daily tick progression
- ‚úÖ Multi-hop movement - Automatic waypoint progression
- ‚úÖ MoveUnitCommand - Pathfinding integration
- ‚úÖ Save/Load mid-journey support

**Movement Features:**
- Units take X days to move (configurable by unit type: cavalry 1 day, infantry 2 days, artillery 3 days)
- A* pathfinding allows moving to any province in one click
- Automatic waypoint hopping through intermediate provinces
- Movement queue tracks in-transit units with progress tracking
- Visual progress bars show movement status on map

**Pathfinding:**
- A* algorithm with h=0 (Dijkstra mode) for MVP
- MVP uses uniform costs (all provinces = 1)
- Future-ready for terrain movement costs
- Future-ready for movement blocking (ZOC, borders, military access)

**Status:** Movement system complete with pathfinding. Units can move across entire map in one click with automatic multi-hop progression.

**See:** [unit-system-implementation.md](unit-system-implementation.md) - Phases 2A, 2B, 2C for detailed documentation.

### 2.3 Combat System

**ENGINE Components:**
- CombatSystem - Resolves battles each tick
- BattleResolver - Deterministic damage calculation
- CombatModifierTypes - Attack, Defense, Discipline, Morale

**Combat Resolution:**
- When opposing units in same province ‚Üí battle
- Damage formula: (attacker strength √ó attack mods) vs (defender strength √ó defense mods)
- Morale damage ‚Üí units retreat when morale breaks
- Casualties calculated with FixedPoint64 (deterministic)

**Modifiers Apply:**
- Terrain bonuses (defender in mountains +25% defense)
- Building bonuses (fort gives +50% defense)
- Tech bonuses (military tech gives +10% discipline)
- General traits (if we add them later)

**Validation:**
- 100 simultaneous battles, verify <10ms resolution
- Save/Load mid-battle, verify outcome unchanged
- Deterministic combat (same inputs = same casualties)

---

## PILLAR 3: DIPLOMACY

### 3.1 Relations System

**ENGINE Components:**
- DiplomacySystem - Manages relations between countries
- RelationState - Opinion values (-200 to +200)
- RelationModifiers - Recent events affecting opinion
- OpinionCalculator - Computes total opinion from modifiers

**Relations Storage:**
```csharp
// Sparse storage: Dictionary<(ushort, ushort), RelationData>
struct RelationData {
    FixedPoint64 baseOpinion;
    List<OpinionModifier> modifiers; // "Stole province", "Alliance", etc
}
```

**Opinion Modifiers:**
- Base relations (cultural similarity, religion, etc.)
- Recent actions (declared war = -100, trade = +10)
- Time decay (modifiers fade over time)

**Validation:**
- 100 countries with relations, verify <5ms opinion calculation
- Save/Load relations, verify modifiers persist
- Deterministic opinion changes

### 3.2 Treaty System

**ENGINE Components:**
- TreatySystem - Active treaties between countries
- TreatyDefinition - Alliance, Trade Agreement, Non-Aggression Pact
- TreatyCommands - ProposeAlliance, AcceptTreaty, BreakTreaty

**Treaty Types:**
- Alliance (join defensive wars, opinion bonus)
- Trade Agreement (economic bonuses, opinion bonus)
- Non-Aggression Pact (cannot declare war, opinion bonus)
- Vassalization (future - subject pays tribute)

**Treaty Storage:**
```csharp
struct Treaty {
    ushort country1;
    ushort country2;
    ushort treatyType;
    int startTick;
    int expirationTick; // 0 = permanent
}
```

**Validation:**
- 50 active alliances, verify war declarations respect treaties
- Save/Load treaties, verify expiration dates correct
- Break treaty, verify opinion penalties apply

---

## PILLAR 4: AI

### 4.1 AI Framework

**ENGINE Components:**
- AISystem - Manages AI decision-making for all AI countries
- AIGoal - Base class for goals (Conquer, Build Economy, Defend)
- AIEvaluator - Scores potential actions (build building, declare war, etc.)
- AIDecisionQueue - Orders AI decisions by priority

**AI Architecture:**
- **Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)** pattern
- Each AI country has active goals (prioritized list)
- Goals generate actions (build farm, recruit unit, declare war)
- Actions scored by evaluators (which action best achieves goal?)
- Top-scoring action executed each tick

**Example Goals:**
- Economic Goal: "Increase income to 100 gold/month"
- Military Goal: "Have 20 units on border with enemy"
- Expansion Goal: "Conquer 5 more provinces"

**Validation:**
- 20 AI countries making decisions, verify <10ms per tick
- AI builds buildings, recruits units, declares wars
- Deterministic AI (same seed = same decisions)

### 4.2 AI Evaluators

**Economic Evaluators:**
- BuildBuildingEvaluator - Which province should build what?
- TaxRateEvaluator - Should we raise/lower taxes?
- ResourcePriorityEvaluator - Spend gold on buildings or units?

**Military Evaluators:**
- RecruitUnitEvaluator - Where to recruit units?
- WarTargetEvaluator - Who should we attack? (weak neighbor with high value provinces)
- DefensePriorityEvaluator - Defend home or push offensive?

**Diplomatic Evaluators:**
- AllianceEvaluator - Who should we ally with? (strong neighbors, shared enemies)
- TreatyEvaluator - Accept/reject treaty proposals
- TrustEvaluator - Can we trust this ally?

**Scoring Formula:**
```csharp
// Example: BuildBuildingEvaluator
float score =
    (expectedIncomeIncrease * 10f) +  // Economic value
    (provinceImportance * 5f) +       // Strategic value
    (-buildTime * 0.1f) +             // Opportunity cost
    (urgency * 20f);                  // How badly we need this
```

**Validation:**
- AI makes sensible decisions (doesn't bankrupt itself)
- AI adapts to player actions (defends when attacked)
- AI difficulty scales (different evaluator weights)

### 4.3 AI Personality

**ENGINE Components:**
- AIPersonality - ScriptableObject defining AI behavior
- PersonalityTraits - Aggressive, Defensive, Economic, Diplomatic

**Personality Modifiers:**
- Aggressive: +50% war target scores, -50% peace scores
- Economic: +100% building scores, -50% military scores
- Diplomatic: +100% alliance scores, prefers treaties over war

**JSON5 Definitions:**
```json5
{
  id: "aggressive_expansionist",
  name: "Aggressive Expansionist",
  war_desire: 1.5,          // 150% war target scores
  building_desire: 0.5,     // 50% building scores
  alliance_threshold: -50   // Only allies with opinion > -50
}
```

**Validation:**
- Aggressive AI declares wars frequently
- Economic AI builds tall (many buildings, few wars)
- Diplomatic AI forms alliances, avoids conflicts
