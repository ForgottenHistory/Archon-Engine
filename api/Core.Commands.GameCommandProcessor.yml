  summary: >-
    Processes GAME layer commands (ICommand) with network synchronization.

    Complements CommandProcessor (which handles IProvinceCommand for ENGINE layer).


    ARCHITECTURE:

    - IProvinceCommand (ENGINE) → CommandProcessor → province state changes

    - ICommand (GAME) → GameCommandProcessor → gameplay state changes


    Both use the same network bridge for multiplayer synchronization.

    Commands are validated locally, then:

    - Host: executes locally and broadcasts to clients

    - Client: sends to host for validation and execution
