    ENGINE LAYER - Diplomatic event definitions


    Architecture:

    - Structs for zero-allocation EventBus

    - Emitted by DiplomacySystem on state changes

    - GAME layer subscribes to trigger UI updates, notifications, AI reactions


    Pattern 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Zero-Allocation)

    - Events are structs (no boxing)

    - EventBus uses EventQueue{T} wrapper

    - Frame-coherent processing
