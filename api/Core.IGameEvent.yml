  summary: >-
    Base interface for all game events.

    Events MUST be structs (not classes) to avoid heap allocations during gameplay.

    The EventBus uses generic EventQueue&lt;T&gt; which keeps events as value types throughout,

    ensuring zero boxing and zero GC pressure.

    content: public interface IGameEvent
